2/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,You would not believe how well this works
01/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Four Stars,You just walk away and it does the rest
12/26/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Awesome love it.,You have to Roomba proof your house but once that is done it is awesome. It's like having a pet that cleans.
08/04/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,Love-hate this vaccuum,"Yes, it's a fascinating, albeit expensive, bit of technology. That said, it is a pain in the butt to clean - every time, if you have the model for pets. Cat hair will clog it in one small room. On the plus side, it gets under the bed, where there could be more pet hair than I care to admit. Can two short haired cats shed faster than Roomba can clean? Will my patience wear out, before my picks, and tweezers and screwdriver? Stay tuned..."
12/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This vacuum is fantastic!!,"Years ago I bought one of the original Roomba's and was underwhelmed - it was slow and got stuck in corners.  But I'm lazy at heart, so decided to try again - and this model is amazing!!  First - no problem in corners - it spins and backs out.  (It also has a spinning brush on the side which whisks all those dust devils out of the corner into the vacuum).  Also, it goes easily from carpet to hardwood floor to doormat and back.  If it encounters a cord on the floor, it backs up and comes back in from another angle.  And I know it's weird to think about - how the heck does it figure out your floor plan, especially when it seems to go in random directions?  It all gets down to math, my friends, and the engineers at Roomba worked it out.  We use it for individual rooms (like our muddy utility room), and for entire house runs.  It's great if you have a dog (you wouldn't believe how much dog hair is under your couch).  Easy to clean, easy to set up and definately easy to use.  (You push a button and walk away!)  Great buy."
12/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Wow!,"Wow.Wow.  I never knew my floors were so dirty before this!  I've set my ""Room by"" to clean every day.  I am astounded each day when I empty the bin.  Where did all this come from??  I have 3 small dogs and can't believe I've spent years living in what I would now consider gross based on what I dump out each day.  I haven't had to vacuum in weeks!  I am going to get this for my 70+ parents. Best invention ever!!!"
8/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Terrible Product - Ruined our Hardwood Floors!,"Wow.. I don't know what to say. This thing worked fine for about a week, then started scratching our hardwood floors in horrible ways across the entire house - by the time we realized it was doing it, the damage was done. The saddest part is that we recently refinished the floors a few months ago (dozens of labor hours + thousands of dollars), so they were immaculate until this horrible robot ruined them. I bought a Roomba back in 2007 for use on hardwoods and it worked fine for years, until it broke - I'm not sure what happened in this case, but it's really sad and definitely will keep me from ever buying one of these again or recommending it to others. The photo attached is only of a small section and doesn't even come close to doing the visible damage justice."
12/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Super-impressed by how well it works!,"Wow, wow, WOW!  I wanted to get one of these a few years ago, but I thought that they may just be 'gimmicky' and not work very well.  After reading the reviews a few months ago, I decided that I would take the plunge and get it, as I figured that even if it was just 'ok', it would suffice in between regular vacuuming.  Wow, am I impressed.  We have a pretty clean household and vacuum regularly.  However, the first three times this thing ran it almost filled up the hopper.  It did an awesome job picking up hair and lint that wasn't picked up by our Dyson.  Set it upstairs and the same results -- super deep clean of our house.  I've been telling everyone I know about how well this works -- and as a bonus -- had a friend over for a Christmas party and he said he's had one for 4 years and it's been working great, although his battery is starting to wear down.  But ... if we can have this last 4 years, I'll be thrilled!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
1/19/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,LOVE THIS,"Wow, the Roomba is the best christmas gift I've ever gotten.  I have 2 cats and 2 dogs and vacuumed regularly but there was still so much hair and dust around the house.  Now all I do to vacuum a room is press a button.  I have to empty the roomba every 15-20 minutes while it runs because it picks up SO MUCH HAIR.  Its amazing.  We love this vacuum! We run it all the time and it gets under chairs couches and beds.  Highly highly recommend."
07/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Stress is bad; Roomba is great.,"Wow, it changes your life. First of all, after a week, EVERYTHING is cleaner. No tufts of pet fur on the AC vents. No more spot vacuuming behind the entertainment center to prolong electronics life. There's just no more fur. It runs on its daily schedule and gets everything.Dirty homes cause stress. Stress reduces life expectancy. Do yourself a favor; stop pinching pennies because it's just a vacuum. It's not just a vacuum; it's peace of mind."
11/26/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba!!,Wow!! is all I can say. I love it!!
02/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,How did I live without this!!?!,"Wow! Now that I don't have to sweep and vacuum up dog hair every day, my life is freed up for activities. But, what will I do with all of this newfound free time? I will have to find some new hobbies, maybe even become Renessaince Festival enthusiast.Seriously though, this little guy is amazing. I have an Australian Shepherd and Dark, Dark, DARK hardwood floors. He sheds like nobody's business,  especially in the Houston heat. I was getting tired of my apartment looking like something out of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly with all of these little 'hairball' tumbleweeds rolling around.Then, this brown box marked Amazon Prime shows up and I open it up to reveal my night in shining armor. A little, round, robotic vacuum that would cure my apartment of this perpetual Wild, Wild West vibe. Buster, as I named my little robot, is amazing. He zips around my apartment everyday at 10am while I am at work and I get to come home to emaculate, clean, HAIRLESS floors! It's a miracle.The 2 minutes of emptying his dust bin that you have to do everyday is nothing compared to the joy he brings you. I HIGHLY recommend buying one of these. You will wonder how you ever lived without it. I also reccomend you attach a mustach or nice hat to him and give him a name."

1/20/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,A big help!,"Would not be without it again.  The real test will be during  shedding season, for now -it is wonderful!Yippee for me!"

Does what it's supposed except when it doesn'tCons :Won't dock itself hasn't since we've owned it , so we just plug it to charge which means we can't program it to clean on a scheduleNeeds frequent maintenance to keep the side brush clean and spinning . Have had to contact support for one new wheel after the machine would only run in a circleEven after all that I would still recommend it"

02/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It's a robot vacuum!,"works well. It is very nice to come home to a clean house. We have dark hardwood floors and have a German Shepherd and two long-haired cats. The roomba is full or hair and dust every day when we get home, but the floors are clean."
01/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Happy with its,Works well. Happy with its performance
10/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Good substitue for occassional vacuuming,"Works well if you turn it on daily and is probably a good substitute to weekly vacuuming.  It does not outdo a vacuum pound for pound for is definitely a convenience. Not cheap!  It's easy to use and does snag it self too often.remember to clean it often for best results.  However be very very careful if you have liquid messes on the floor.  Check to make sure no liquid soils around. If you don't this will run over any messes and pretty much spread it all over the house, leaving you with a bigger headache than before.  Overall it's tech that is worth getting."
10/14/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Two Stars,Works well but I was shocked when the vacuum was deliver with heaps of dog fur!!

04/07/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Works great and at a great price,"Works really well! Docks its self almost every time and does a great job cleaning. Needs to be emptied often, but still beats having to vacuum everyday. Has no problem picking up hair from my two dogs."
12/23/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We have all hard floors but it goes over the various rugs just fine. We have two dogs and two cats,Works really well and is much more thorough than I am.  We have all hard floors but it goes over the various rugs just fine.  We have two dogs and two cats.  One of the best things I've ever purchased.
3/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Doin the Roombaaaaaa!,"Works like a champ. Does its work and goes home to charge. Very cool product. The dogs don't seem to mind it either. They seem indifferent, the rascals.We have a very dark area rug with a goldish paisley pattern it doesn't like. It gets confused on it and will stop. It thinks it's going over a cliff or something. Other than that it is really rather remarkable. Works awesome on the hardwoods. Collects all the dog hair like magic."
10/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Four Stars,Works great. Will get tangled in cords but other than that a great product. My wife loves it.

3/29/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Yep, it really works",Works great. Push the button and head to the store and when you get back your floor is clean. It's a little noisier than I hoped and has trouble getting onto our rug which is why I only give it 4 stars. I wouldn't use it for carpet floors. It docks well and does a great job going around chair legs and corners.

05/08/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great machine,Works great.  My only complaint would be that it is a little big to fit under some furniture bir I guess I just need to pull out the broom and sweep the dog hair out to the open area.

Cleans extremely well picking up fine lint and dust on hard wood floors and carpet.  Battery life is very good too between charges.  I have not had to clean out the brushes, only empty out the dust receptacle and vacuum the filter."

2/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,My cleaning wizard!,"Works great, I scheduled it to run twice a week. It learned every inch of the house. I have a labrador and two black cats, it picks up all pet hair. My floors are tile and hardwood and they look great. Make sure to clean out hair and dirt after each cleaning cycle. Great investment."

(First sporadically when I remembered to start and 2 weeks on an everyday setting) and our wheel is broken. Customer service was friendly and did troubleshoot, but very disappointing that such an investment would break so quickly. Really is a game changer in terms of vacuuming if you have dogs, but concerned how long it will last given this problem."
3/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,Works great! Would like to own two of them.
8/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,wooden floors stay clean.,Works great! This is a fine product. I've had this for 3 months now and it really helps me keep my wooden floors clean.

5/20/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing!,Works amazingly well. We have 2 dogs and allergies. This vacuum picks up so much more than my upright vacuum and I don't have to lift a finger! I vacuumed with my old vacuum right before I used this one and the amount of dirt it picked up was kind of gross! (Shown in the photo attached) We have been living in filth that we didn't know was there.  It is very easy to maintain and I love that you can schedule a time for it to work. Also it easily goes from carpet to hard floor to rugs without getting stuck. I wish I had purchased this years ago! My cleaning life has forever been changed!

2/20/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Dumb as a brick but gets the job done,"With the exception of the chair/table leg ""spin""  the path finding is dumber than most bots in games, but it manages to get the floor rather clean through sheer persistence."

1/22/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love this vac,With 4 pets the only downside is I have to empty it a few times as it does the entire first floor of my home.  It really works great and the convenience of only pushing a button every other day to keep control of the pet hair on the wood floors is terrific.
3/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,a true hard worker,"With 3 cats at home, this robot has been a lifesaver and a blessing. I program it for 3 days a week, and now I don't spend all weekend cleaning my floors."

Works great, we run it every day and it always has dust and dirt in the bin. Our floors have never been cleaner. Will buy another when this one wears out."
12/03/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,The Labs shed like crazy and we always have hair everywhere,"Wish we had purchased a long time ago!  We have 3 indoor dogs, 2 being large Labs.  The Labs shed like crazy and we always have hair everywhere.  It required daily vac/sweeping to keep it under control at all.  The Roomba 650 works great!  We run it every day and it keeps the hair cleaned up.It will not totally replace vacuuming, as the Roomba cannot get under the couch or chairs.  It will run a long time on a charge, but if you are like us and there is a lot of hair to pick up, you will need to stop it occasionally and empty the collection area and brushes.Overall I am thrilled (and a bit mesmerized :-) ) by this product."

11/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Good gift,Wife loves it.  Got points for this purchase.  Turn it on and leave.  When you get back the room was done and the I robot was charging.
01/06/2016,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing,Why I have not bought one sooner? This device is a must have for busy families! It works well and the noise is tolerable. I run it every time we leave the house and it's my little miracle :) I would definitely buy again and probably upgrade to a model that is compatible with the light house
8/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,No complaints here!,Why have I not ordered this sooner! This is the best thing ever for my laminate floors. I turn it on almost every morning before I leave for work and come home to nice and clean floors. It definitely saves me a ton of time during the week.
02/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It's the best thing since sliced bread,Why didn't I order this sooner?!?! It's the best thing since sliced bread!!
8/15/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Best money ever spent,Who knew there was so much dust and cat hair EVERY SINGLE DAY in  my room?  For the first time  ever I feel like  my room is clean...and with no effort!  I recommend this to everyone.
11/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We call it Herbie and we love it,"Who knew a vacuum cleaner would be the best gift of the Xmas season. I'll keep this short n sweet. This vacuum really works well and is super easy to use and low maintenance. Took it out of the box and 2 minutes later Herbie is cleaning the house.. going into corners, under the couch, along all the edges and after about an hour he finds his way back to his docking station, whistles a victory song and recharges himself. It's fantastic!"

09/03/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Glad I finally made the purchase,"While the Roomba isn't perfect, it does a much better job on the floors than I had really anticipated.  It does a good job on my dense, low pile carpets, and easily moves back and forth from hardwood to carpet with no problem.  There are two improvements that would make it perfect. When it moves from bare floor to carpet, there doesn't seem to be enough suction to fully clean the edge of the rug.  I need to periodically go over this area with my small vacuum.  Also, it bumps pretty hard when it comes to a dark colored obstacle.  There hasn't been any damage because of the rubber bumper on the Roomba, but  the bumping is noisy and tends to move things around a bit.  However, these are minor issues and don't detract from the overall performance.  My husband was totally skeptical when I decided to buy the Roomba, but he is now a convert.  I love sitting in my recliner, reading, while my house is getting vacuumed."
04/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it so much I bought another and gifted it!,"Where on earth has this product been all of my life???? If you had given be a trial day, then told me it costs $5000, I would be tempted to buy it. I have a pug (shed central!!!!) and a pitt mix (mild shedding) and their hair is no match! I run it about twice a week and only need to mop behind it. Every so often it may miss a small patch on my floor but it hardly ever does. It picks up hair, dirt, and everything in between! Do be sure you clear everything off your floor, it doesn't have hands, and let it go! I wish it were a touch thinner to go under my new couches but it went under my old ones without difficulty. Every so often mine will stop for me to empty the cartridge before continuing, but that usually happens if I use it right after I blow dry my hip length thick hair, and well, you could hardly dock it points for that."
03/12/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,My wife bought it without asking me...,"When my wife showed me what she had gotten I was certain it was a waste of money. I clean the floors in our house, but after shoulder surgery it was difficult. We have wood floors with area rugs and I use an oreck vaccum on all of them. I was amazed at how well this little robot kept the floors clean. It even goes under the furnature to get the dust bunnies I only got once a month. The only problem we have is that once in a while it will get stuck under the kitchen cabinet. Over all I am well pleased with the performance and have had no problems so far."
1/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Review for pet owners with HARDWOOD and/or TILE floors,"When I was trying to decide whether or not to buy this item, I poured through the reviews looking for customers that used this only on hardwood and tile floors.  I didn't see any reviews that particularly met this, so I wanted to add this to the plethora of already existing reviews so that people in similar situations would have a helpful review.The big question... does this product work on hardwood and tile floors?  You bet it does!I live in a house that has only hardwood floors in the living and bedroom areas, and tile in the bathrooms and kitchens.  To clean the floors, I would typically have to sweep them, and then mop the the floors with a bissel steam mop.  When you own a dog, sweeping the floors constantly is a must.  The roomba 650 effectively takes sweeping out of the equation.  In fact, using Roomba produces better results than manually sweeping the floors.  You don't have to deal with rogue dirt and debris falling off the end of the bristles.  The result is a perfectly clean floor.I set the roomba to run each night after I go to bed.  I was concerned that he would be too loud, but with the door closed I can barely hear him running around in the other room.  It's a quiet machine.  By running it each night, every morning the floor is clear and free of debris.  Note that you may need to roomba proof the room a little (move a few things to make sure he can get everywhere and doesn't snag loose wires, etc...).By keeping my hardwoods and tiles free of debris, I've noticed that the dirt and grime builds up less frequently and I can steam mop the floors less than I used to.The only downside is that the waste basin is fairly small.  It's easy enough to clear out each time I run it, but I feel like if it stored a little more that the programming feature would be a bit more useful.I haven't had to change the filter, and nothing has gotten tangled in the brushes yet to where I've needed to do in depth cleaning of the roomba itself (though tools were provided for that) and I've had it for about 4 months now.The bottom line is that this has saved me the hassle of having to sweep every other day.  Instead, roomba takes care of it nightly and my hardwoods and tile floors have never looked better.  It has removed SO MUCH STRESS from dealing with them that it's amazing.  If you own a pet and have hardwood or tile floors you want cleaned regularly, this is a MUST BUY!  It's pricey, sure, but it's worth every penny."
10/24/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Every dog should come with one of these!,"When I was given the opportunity to give this little vacuum robot a try I was skeptical that it would clean up pet hair better than the 780 and 770 Roomba models.  Over the past few months I've been pretty impressed with how those Roombas pick up almost all of the dog hair that crosses their path.  So I was intrigued as to how much better the 650 model which is intended for cleaning up in houses with pets would fare.  I set the 650 out on a floor that had previously been vacuumed just to see what it could do.  I was surprised that it completed the cleaning cycle with a bin full of dog hair.  Not to shabby!Set up for the vac is pretty simple.  Just charge it before the first use and hit the clean button to send the little robot on it's way.  It takes our robot about and hour and a half to two hours to clean the second floor of our house.Setting the vac to clean on a schedule is very easy.  The menu is easy to navigate, and making changes to the schedule is simple.The collection container for this vac appears to be slightly larger than the one on the 770 and 780 models which are small. If I run  the Roomba every day and empty the waste collection bin after each run, I don't have any issues with the bin filling up mid-cleaning.  Only when the vac hasn't run for a day do I have an issue with the bin filling up before the robot is done cleaning.  So even with the slightly larger capacity, you'll still want to empty the bin after each use.I've had a few issues with the vacuum getting stuck on things or sucking up things it shouldn't.  If you leave something out with long strings, it can get caught up in the brushes for the vac.  We've had a few instances where the vac has wound it self up on toys with pull cords or clothes that my kids have left on their bedroom floors.  When this happens the vac simply stops.  Unwinding it is easy enough.  Nothing that has gotten caught in the vac has been damaged so I think that's a positive aspect.The 650 robot comes with just one tool for cleaning the brushes while the 770 and 780 models come with two tools for cleaning the brushes and cutting loose any hair that may wind itself around them.  It can take a little bit of time to free brushes, but I found it easier than cleaning the brushes of my upright vacs.  I think it's a shame that the cleaning tool I find to be the most useful is not included with the 650 model.Overall, I'm very happy with the roomba.  It's eliminated the need for me to pull out the vacuum each day.  As a mom with a young baby I appreciate that this little robot saves me about twenty minutes of housework each day.  That's twenty minutes that I can spend with my baby instead of cleaning.Compared with the 770 and 780 models you will note a few differences.  The filter system on the 650 is different.  Instead of two filters you have one larger one that seems like it is made of cheaper materials.  The plastic housing for the 650 feels and looks cheaper than that of the higher numbered models which have a sleeker appearance and nicer materials for their housing. Performance wise they appear to be pretty much the same.  From the bottom of the vacuum, they're essentially the same machine.  As far as I can tell, the only difference is the appearance of the top of the robot.  They all function the same.The higher numbered models carry with them a more substantial price tag.  I don't know if it's necessarily worth spending a couple of hundred of dollars more to get the next level up series.  What I can tell you is you get more spare parts and optional accessories with the higher level series.  With the 650 a virtual wall, two extra filters and a cleaning tool are included.  With the next level up you will find a remote control in the box along with some replacement brushes (quantity and type depends on the model you select) an additional tool and either two virtual walls or two virtual wall lighthouses.One thing that I LOVE about the 650 model is it comes with an actual paper Owner's Manual and quick start guide.  With the 700 series you have to watch a frustrating DVD that doesn't give you half the information that is contained in the Owner's Manual.  Reading through this manual alerted me to the fact that there's a ""Virtual Wall Halo"" (not included) that can be purchased to keep the Roomba from going after your pets bowls.  I had resigned myself to the fact that I either needed to remember to pick up the dog's bowls before I started Roomba or wind up cleaning up puddles from it hitting the water bowl.Overall, the Roomba 650 is a handy vacuum to have. By no means is this little vac as poweful as an upright vacuum, but it certainly does a good job of keeping the floors neat and tidy.  It takes the chore out of cleaning up after your cat or dog."
12/16/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Baby Roomba...,"When I first told my lady that I bought a ""robot vacuum cleaner"" I was in for a little trouble. She thought it was a ridiculous idea and waste of money. After almost a year with the Roomba, she's converted and quite possibly in love with the machine! Apparently its new name is ""Baby Roomba.""The Roomba shipped promptly and arrived with no damage. The packaging was adequate and set-up was a breeze. I scheduled it to run every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8:00am without needing to consult the directions. I've yet to setup the Virtual Wall, but it looks easy enough. It's fascinating to watch it explore the room, although frightening to wake up to on the occasional lazy Friday.It kept my ~900 square foot apartment incredibly clean on its own (I'll admit to vacuuming the old-fashioned way about once every other month) and has only had a few mishaps. It's closed doors behind itself occasionally and been unable to return to the dock. It disagreed with a rubber-band once, but seems to handle bobby-pins with ease.I do a regular maintenance cleaning on it once a month, which might be excessive but I like to keep it clean and healthy. I need to order a new filter and brushes for it soon as well, but that seems cheap enough.All in all, it's been one of my absolute favorite purchases! I have no complaints and hope to add another one to my now larger home soon. If you are on the fence, go for it! It will be the new member of your family :)"
2/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Get 1, u will love it","What can I say. Push the button and let it ride.  Def a little loud, so no TV when is on.  I turn it on before I leave."
10/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Pet Owners Be Warned - Read this if you own pets.,"What a life saver.  My wife and I own two rabbits.  We usually let them roam around our 2 BR apartment in the mornings and evenings.  Although they are litter box trained, when they free range they tend to drop pellets randomly.  It happens.  Not a big deal as bunny poo is easy to clean up.  But it does get annoying constantly stepping on it, especially when guests come over and you have to vacuum the entire apartment.I got so tired of it that I put down the money and got a Roomba.  What a miracle.  Significantly less bunny droppings.  I run it couple times per week and it works miracles.  The first few times it pulls up a lot of dirt you may not have known you had.  It only gets stuck in one area of  the apt, under an Ikea chair, but I put a pillow under it and that fixes the problem.PET OWNERS WARNING - The first few times I ran this the rabbits were out.  It is a robot and does not care about your pet.  Unfortunately, your pet is not a robot and may care about the Roomba making them move.  In my case my male rabbit's response was to plop down a rather nasty bit of excrement that wasn't the normal hard pellet.  The Roomba also does not care what it picks up.  In this case the pile of wet excrement left by my rabbit got smeared under the Roomba (thankfully missing the brush) and then smeared more on the carpet.  Not a nightmare to clean up but definitely not fun and left a rather unpleasant aroma in the apartment.  If this were a dog or cat I cannot even imagine how much worse it could have been.  Also, google pets attacking Roomba and you'll see quite a few $$$ Roombas chewed to pieces by dogs.  So, before leaving your pet alone with one of these, give it some test runs or you may not like the results."

12/20/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba,"Well....its day four in our Roomba household. So far its doing its job. It did get stuck under our fridge a few times. Temporary fix for that is putting some hamburger helper boxes in front so it can't jamb itself underneath. I do believe it is doing a good job at keeping the floors clean. Keep in mind that I have no children and no pets. I bought this model because I have long hair and shed quite a bit. Hoping that this model will be able to deal with it. I didn't really find the noise all that bothersome as others have mentioned in other ratings of this product. Also...super easy to setup. Basically took it out of the box, pulled the battery tab, charged it, and sent it on its way!"
05/12/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Get's the floor... a little cleaner?  Leaves lots behind,"Well, I bought this after reading a lot of positive reviews and have to say I'm disappointed.  It does fill up with a lot of lint and dirt after each cleaning, but the hard wood floors just don't look vacuumed at all.  There are tiny pieces of grass, crumbs, etc left when it has finished that stick out like a sore thumb.  If I have to vacuum after my $450 robot vacuums, then why have it?  I'm going to try to return it.  Not sure how that works.  I'll try to remember to update and let you know."

I could not keep up with all the sweeping behind two dogs and my 4-yr-old without this thing. We even named it, ""Shirley"". (We were always saying, ""surely, it's vaccuumed the bedroom by now.."")"
12/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Much better than the older models,"We've owned and used several iRobot vacuums throughout the years. The first one we purchased had a very small dirt bin and was basically a toy or novelty item. The second iRobot we purchased was the Pet model which was supposed to work like the iRobot 650. While the older Pet model worked pretty good, the newest model is a great improvement. The 650 has a larger dirt bin making the vacuum far more useful as the robot actually cleans rooms without too much maintenance. Maintenance seems a bit easier too as I was able to quickly disassemble and reassemble the 650 for cleaning. It helped that iRobot has included onsite videos showing how you can take apart and clean the iRobot vacuum.I do wish iRobot had included both the circular brush cleaning tool as part of the 650 cleaning kit. You will receive the ""comb"" used to remove hair from the brushes as part of the cleaning kit.We have yet to decide a name for the the 650 as we are debating between Dr. Susan Calvin (one of the fictional robotists featured in Dr Asimov's robot books) or Daneel who was a robot detective  in Caves of Steel written by Asimov. I am leaning towards Daneel as the 650 is really good at seeking out dirt and removing it.Recommend."
01/04/2016,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great for those with little time!,"We've nicknamed our little Roomba ""Remy"" as we think that he's funny roaming around our apartment.  Our apartment is pretty small (only a couple hundred square feet) and it seems to get to every inch.  We have set him to run every day while we're out and we always come back to a sparkling apartment.  Most days we find Remy back on its charger, however, there are instances where it gets stuck.  Most often we find him under our couch where it manages to get under, but is unable to get back out.  We might also find it in our bathroom where it has been stuck behind a floor rug that has bunched up behind him.  We do empty the trap every day, but that's mostly because we have a rabbit that sheds like the dickens and his hair fills up the trap pretty quickly.  Otherwise he does seem to suck up all the dirt, fur and hay that lines our floor.  I've been very happy with this Roomba and would definitely recommend it."
9/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Why did I wait so long to get this?,"We've had this running about two months, 3-4 times a week. It works great not only on the carpet but the wood floors as well. I haven't seen any issues on the legs of furniture as mentioned by others and the cleaning and maintenance couldn't be easier."
10/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Don't bother,"We've had this roomba for 40 days, it already broke and isn't eligible for return. Don't waste your money."
12/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,3 years of love!,"We've had this robot for almost three years! I don't know how we ever lived without it! We have 3 small children, 2 dogs and a cat, we have high foot traffic and roomba cleans better than if I did it myself except I don't need to lift a finger. I set the timer for it to clean before we wake up everyday. Although, we probably run it more than that, set it to clean when you go shopping and come back to clean floors. You need to love your roomba back though. First, if you have kids, you have to name it. My kids named ours Ruby. We empty ruby's contents everyday and give her a deep clean once a month. Every few months we replace the spinner and filter parts. When her battery wasn't holding well, it was an easy Amazon purchase, $20 for a battery, plug in and good as new! I like that we can do all of the maintenance ourself since we are a DIY family. We've used ruby so much now that the tread on the wheels have warn down completely and we are finally retiring her to a different floor and bringing in a fresh new roomba that we've promptly named Zumba. Roomba isn't without a few quirks though. It's best to do a walk through before running and pick up anything that would get stuck in any normal vacuum, such as shoelaces, clothes, etc. We had a chair that roomba would always get stuck on, so we would have to pick it up every evening. Dirt and grim builds up on the sensors, so it won't run and dock as well when dirty, like I said, you have to love your roomba back."
05/03/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love this little sucker!,"We've had this for a week and scheduled it to run every day last week after my wife and I left for work. We have about 2000 square feet of hardwood downstairs that felt dirty the whole week after sweeping on Sundays. The Roomba, which arrived on Sunday luckily, worked right out of the box but I restrained myself from using it and let it charge fully, which took about an hour for the light to go from orange to green. I ran it 3 times that day and was amazed how much dust, cat hair and relatively large ""things"" the Roomba picked up. There was a full cat's-worth of hair in there every time I ran it and this continued for about 3 days. On Thursday I could tell we were getting into the maintenance phase since there was only a small mouse's-worth of cat hair in the bin...Friday even less.When I first setup the charging base I put it in our living room which is kind of enclosed by our couch. I watched as the Roomba made its way through the entire downstairs but I noticed it really loved our open dining room and kitchen most of all so I decided to relocate the charging base to that area so I wouldn't come home to find it stuck in there with a dead battery. I was a little worried about all the reviewers talking about how the Roomba would get stuck under dining room chairs. The Roomba does have a tendency to spend a little more time than I would like trying to escape the confines of our dining room chairs. I'm guessing the Roomba is programmed with mathematical equations that determine the angle at which it should turn around and go when it hits something and usually it works very well when faced with a wider object but since chair legs are very narrow it spends a lot of time turning around and hitting the other chair legs. After a minute or so of playing bumper cars however it always makes it out.One thing I really love is the wall hugging feature. It knows when it finds a wall and cleans along the whole thing. Then it bumps into the next wall, determines the angle it needs to turn to continue going straight and does so. The Roomba seems to have some randomization programmed in it as well though since it gets bored of doing the same thing for too long and decides to do something different just to keep the cleaning process exciting. If it goes straight for too long it will decide to turn around and go the other direction, usually parallel to the last path it traveled like if it was mowing the lawn. If it finds a particularly dirty spot the little dirt sensor light will flash and it will spiral around the area for a few spins to make sure that area is picked up.The docking feature is cool. When it's time to go home, either by it sensing a low battery charge or by you pressing the dock button, it will crawl back onto its charging base if the sensor on the Roomba ""finds"" the sensor on the charger. If there is a weakness to this ""dumb"" Roomba then this would be it. Since the homing feature is limited in range to about 8-10 feet I would guess and the 2 sensors have to be in sight of each other the Roomba doesn't really know where to go when it's time to charge. As I initially said we placed the charger in the living room and when the Roomba started flashing the dock button because the battery was getting low and began searching for its base, it happened to be cleaning our dining room at the time. I hopefully cheered it on as it searched for the charging base but it seemed to always go the wrong direction. I really couldn't tell if there was a difference in the pattern it took while searching for its dock vs its normal cleaning pattern. After about 10 minutes of wandering through the dining room I got sad for the little thing and brought it into the living room. When it got about 8 feet away from the dock sensor it paused and started zig-zagging towards the charger and when it got a few inches away it slowed down and crept perfectly onto the 2 contact points. Since relocating the charger to our dining room the floors have been spotless and the Roomba has been happily sitting in its base every day when I come home, silently begging me to empty its full stomach of floor yuckies.You wouldn't think saving 15 minutes of sweeping a week would make this thing worth it but my wife would disagree with you. It's probably not just that but knowing the floors are clean every day when we come home and seeing how much stuff it picks up. Happy wife happy life I guess.CONS:If your floor plan is large and intricate the Roomba may be unable to find the docking station when it's time to chargeThe front bumper will get scuffed very quickly***Though it does detect that it's about to run into something and slows down to minimize the impact and the damage is only superficial.The cleaning pattern is very random***It may completely skip the room it started in and clean the next room 3 times but it seems to eventually make it everywhere.It can only be scheduled once a day and won't continue after a charge***This is only a problem if you NEED it to clean everything right away. It may clean 1 room 5 times, skip another room and need to charge and once it does that it will not clean again until the next day. You could manually schedule it again if you wanted to or kick off an unscheduled cleaning by pushing the CLEAN button anytime.You'll feel like a fancy pants but you won't carePROS:It picks up the dirt you see and the dirt you didn't know was even thereIt knows when it's about to hit something***When it senses an object in front of it it slows down considerably. If it's really narrow like a dining chair leg it may not sense it in time though.It tells you about its problems***If something goes wrong it tells you so. I found that out when I picked it up while it was cleaning and a nice lady voice told me to bugger off and let it finish or something like that. ;)The scheduler is great***We programmed it to clean every weekday at 10am and it sticks to it. (See CONS)It's easy to empty***The back bin pulls off easily with one press of a button and is easy to dump in your trash. Pet hair will tend to stick to the filter so I just pull that off in 1 or 2 clumps. The filter comes out simply and I usually bang it a few times on the trash can to clear the dust. The 2 bottom brush wheels come out with the press of 2 little spring clips and the larger of the 2 will need to have long hairs untangled from time to time. A tool that looks like a letter opener comes with the Roomba for this purpose.It's powerful but quiet***It has a very powerful sucking motor but it's much quieter than a regular vacuum.Your days of sweeping or vacuuming your hard floors will be over***Honestly the Roomba sweeps better than we ever have so we have gladly given up those responsibilities. We haven't used it on our upstairs carpet because we don't want to so I can't speak on its abilities there. With our new and thick carpet however I would imagine the brush and bin would be full after 5 minutes with carpet pieces so that would be counterproductive anyway.UPDATE almost a year laterIt's still going strong. It runs 5 days a week M-F while we're at work and we haven't had to sweep with a broom once since we got it. I usually empty the bin on Wednesday and then again on Sunday. We could probably empty it only once a week but it's pretty darn full after 3 days so I feel better not making the motor work extra hard. When we ordered this it came with a free bonus pack with an extra filter but honestly I don't think it will ever need it. Every few months I run some water through the filter and it looks brand new again.It sweeps our entire downstairs which is about 1700 square feet of faux hardwood vinyl. It has only gotten stuck a few times and not made it back to its docking station but it's been my fault most of the time. Usually it's because it'll run over a sock or suck up my shoe lace and it turns itself off if the roller can no longer turn. It has shut itself in our guest bathroom a few times as well. If you let it in a room with a door that opens in, there is a good chance that it will push the door closed and eventually run out of power in there. The good news is that the room will be spotless.My wife and I agree this is our best purchase ever."
10/23/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Very good, but consider the Roomba 880 instead.","We've had several different Roombas over the years, including this model, and even a few competing products from other companies.  With almost all of them, including this Roomba 650, the cleaning that they did and the convenience that they provided has been wonderful and improved with each new model.Despite they constant progress, the effort required to clean the brushes out was the one flaw that always made us wonder if vacuuming robots were even worth the cost and time.  Because we have two dogs that shed a lot, we've always opted to accept having to spend 15 or 20 minutes each week cleaning the hair out of the brushes, especially since that brush cleaning has gotten slightly shorter and easier with each new model of Roomba.The Roomba 880 has largely solved the hair in the brush issue.  Its new design is dramatically better than previous ones, including this 650, both in getting the hair into the bin, instead of onto the brushes, and making it easy to remove the hair that does end up on the brushes.This robot is great, but we recommend that you consider the 880ÊiRobot Roomba 880 Vacuum Cleaning Robot For Pets and Allergies.  It is worth the extra cost if you don't want to spend a bunch of time each week cleaning hair out of the brushes."
09/12/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Perfect for fussy folks like us,"We've had ours for a year this month. We just love not having to sweep anymore.THE ROOMBA IS FOR YOU AS LONG AS:1. You have no tall (higher than Berber-height, that is) carpeting.2. You have no young kids that naturally spread toys/debris all over the floor...or are willing to pick everything up before letting the Roomba do its thing.3. You have a good spot to put the charging station...for example, under a china cabinet where it's not going to get stepped on, yet visible enough to the Roomba to ""find"" it when it's done.4. Everyone is able to leave the ""work area"" for an hour or so when the Roomba does its thing.OUR ENVIRONMENT:Our home is about 2/3 tiled and 1/3 Berber carpeting. We have 2 boys, 8 and 5, and a rat terrier.WHAT WE DO BEFORE THE ROOMBA DOES ITS THING TO ENSURE SATISFACTION-We sweep the floors of each linen/hall closet, kitchen pantry, as well as our 1/2 bath, and close all said doors. The stuff we sweep we simply sweep ""out"" for the Roomba to subsequently pick up.-We move all 6 dining chairs (upside down, ""school style"") on top of the dining table. This helps to allow the Roomba to move freely about, without moving back-and-forth repeatedly around chair/table legs, which drains battery life and causes missed spots due to the Roomba not being able to fit between chair/table legs.-We move small items, i.e. trash cans/dog ""beds"" onto tables/counters.WE LOVE THE ROOMBA BECAUSE:-It's PERFECT on hard floors, because there is virtually zero dog hair/crumbs/whatnot left, including by walls that one sometimes overlooks when sweeping.-The hard floors are cleaned more-often (by virtue of the Roomba making it much, much easier for us) and as a result need to be mopped less frequently.-The bottom of our feet stay cleaner (we leave our footwear at the door).-We appreciate walking across clean, debris-free hard floors; in the pre-Roomba days when we'd get busy with life and couldn't sweep/vacuum for a week or two, we felt ""forced"" to finally clean up when we got sufficiently annoyed by walking on dog hair/small debris. No more. If you like the ""clean, recently-swept floor feel"" under your bare feet, Roomba is exactly what the Dr ordered.-It vacuums under all furniture taller than 4"", including our master bed, eliminating the need to remove our mattress to finally vacuum under the bed, which we frankly only did every 6 months or so. Yuck no more.-It vacuums the carpeted (bedroom) areas well, though being a battery-operated machine, it doesn't have the powerful suction of a conventional vacuum cleaner; thus, we agree that it probably wouldn't do well with especially-tall carpeting.THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:-Wires need to be arranged so that none of them dangle on the floor where Roomba goes. We did this by arranging them behind furniture, and raising our phone/tablet charging wires onto the end table when about to ""Roomba"".-Having kids, we don't program our Roomba, knowing they scatter toys; we therefore have them clean up first and then manually ""start"" Roomba when ready.-In the boys' bedrooms we have them place all ""loose"" floor stuff (desk chairs, floor decor, toy containers and so forth) on their own beds so Roomba can move freely about across their respective floors.-As other reviewers have said, have patience. It takes time for the Roomba to work its magic. If it misses a spot or doesn't pick something up, be patient and don't judge it by a single pass over a given surface. On its subsequent passes, it'll pass over the same spot from various directions so whatever it missed WILL get picked up.-It DOES work well on non-tall rugs/carpeting, by virtue of passing over the same given spot repeatedly and from different directions. The bin in our Roomba, for example, gets full (mostly dust and dog hair) after doing our master bedroom after only a few days since the last vacuuming, whereas gets less-full after doing the guest bedroom where no one sleeps on a regular basis.BOTTOM LINE:Yes, it's expensive. But, if you have largely hard floors and non-tall carpeting, walk barefoot at home and are fussy about having clean hard floors to walk on, the Roomba is your long-lost best friend."
9/19/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Pretty neat!,"We've had our Roomba for about 2 months now and we use it once, sometimes twice per week. We have two dogs (greyhound and maltipoo) who don't shed too badly, but the fur can accumulate pretty quickly (our house is all tile so you will see it blowing across the floor like a tumbleweed) so we decided to get this to help in between cleanings. This is pretty amazing to watch in action, or at least it is to me. The Roomba really is a smart product for the most part. it gets into so many nooks and crannies that I struggled to reach before (e.g. under the bed, nightstands, armoire, etc.) It usually picks up on where walls and ledges are and carefully navigates around them, although it has banged into the wall on occasion. When in operation, this thing can be pretty loud, but not much louder than a regular house vacuum. I have to say, I was really amazed at the amount of fur our Roomba picked up! I had no idea there was even that much around! But, I did witness it go over dirt a few times and not pick it up, so it's not 100% effective. Regardless, it does exactly what we need to and helps keep our floor clean between normal house cleaning so it has been a great purchase for us. I haven't used the barriers or scheduling program so I can't comment on those."
01/11/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Convenient and Fun, but not perfect","We've had it for about a week, and here's our thoughts so far:Pros:1) Easy to set up, from unboxing to first scheduled run takes as little as a couple of minutes.2) As a regular maintenance vacuuming device, it does a quite decent job.  It doesn't have the suction power of a regular vacuum cleaner, but it compensates with easier operation and more frequent runs.3) When the battery runs out, it's smart enough to return to the dock and recharge.  Even when the dock is in a separate room with many turns away, the vacuum had no problem finding the base.4) It can be quite entertaining to watch this robot run around.  No kidding.  And my family (dogs included) aren't bothered by the noise at all.Cons:1) Range is limited.  The robot can run for a little over an hour on each fully charge, and it will run in a rather random pattern during that time until the battery dies.  In other words, if you have a smaller house, the vacuum may cover 100% of the space, more than once at certain places even.  But if the house is big, it will likely miss many places.  But as mentioned above, the vacuum will probably cover the missing spot on a separate run. Probably.I know some of Roomba's competitor uses different technology and alogorithm to map the room and plan the routes, some run in the fashion of a lawn mower, which is probably more efficient than Roomba's ""random"" bump and turn method.  But I kind of like Roomba's way bc with limited suction power, it probably does take a couple runs to pick up all the dirt.  With that said, I do wish the battery capacity can be increased a little and the range be extended."
8/28/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great robot vacuum,"We've had it for 8 months now and it's still working great. Only has gotten stuck 3 times and vacuums every day on the scheduler. It gets completely full with pet hair every day from our two dogs. It misses some spots, but fits in most places. I wish the canister was bigger to hold more, but other than that it is great!"
6/15/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Replaced our 550 with the 650-much better!,"We've been using our Roomba 650 for about 6 weeks now and so far, it's working great!I got the 650 from a well-known home shopping channel using flexpay to replace a model 550 that, after almost 4 years, had begun not finding its station & wasn't picking up particulates like it used to. The 550 would also stop and announce it was time to ""clean Roomba's brushes"" when there was barely any debris in the brushes or the bin. I had even taken off the bottom of the Roomba & cleaned the brass sensor under the brushes thoroughly, but it didn't help.The 650 looks almost identical to the 550 from the outside, but the dirt bin has a small motor or fan inside that apparently pulls in/vacuums up more pet hair/dirt/etc. because the bin gets full!I automatically check the bin once or twice a week because it has yet to announce that it's full or that the brushes need to be cleaned.The 650 also has the updated Roomba brushes with the bigger yellow end caps. These brushes clean much better and the end caps are much easier to deal with when cleaning than previous Roomba brushes.The 650 has ended up picking up an occasional dryer sheets & small pet toys without stopping. I'll discover them when I check the bin.The only teeny, tiny downside is that the Control Station/remote (white) that I used with the Roomba 550 apparently will not work with the Roomba 650. I tried getting the two to communicate/pair but they wouldn't. I really like that Control Station better than the remote that came with the 650. The Control Station allows you to not only operate the Roomba, but to program it as well, should the Roomba get stuck somewhere in the house allowing the battery to drain, thus losing the on-board schedule. That being said, the 650 hasn't done that yet, like our 550 used to.Overall, VERY pleased with the Roomba 650.>^..^<"
01/06/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Surprisingly effective at keeping floors clean between full vacuuming sessions,"We were skeptical that this little gadget could actually do a good job getting our carpet and tile floors clean, but we have been pleasantly surprised. I am not sure who is more fascinated by watching the Roomba do its job - the humans in the household or the cats.The dirt cup can hold a fair amount of debris before it needs to be emptied and I'm always surprised at how much it has picked up while it's rolling around the house. It has definitely kept our floors cleaner than they would have otherwise been between full-on vacuuming sessions."
12/23/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Roomba vs, Samoyed dog hair.","We were a little hesitant in making this purchase initially since our cleaning challenge is that we have 2 very hairy Samoyed dogs. Prior to Hazel (we call our roomba Hazel after a maid on an old TV sitcom) we used our central vac system almost daily. Now we let Hazel clean the whole first floor of our house daily and after 2 months we are still amazed how much she collects. Every day the bin is full of superfine Samoyed hair. Hazel is a huge time saver since she is so thorough at cleaning in all of the corners and under things. With all of this fine dog hair (Samoyeds have hair up to 10"" long)  floating around it is necessary to clean the brushes every other day but I find with the circular brush cleaning tool it is a relatively quick process.So if you have a hairy dog or cat problem consider a roomba as a first class hair collection tool."
5/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We use this daily and it makes a huge difference ...,We use this daily and it makes a huge difference compared to standard vacuuming. I think the carpet is much cleaner than with the once a week schedule we had before.
7/13/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It's our new Pet!,"We use our Roomba to help out around the house even though we do not have a pet we do have two toddlers and a carpet that likes to shed.  We hide the charging station partly under the couch for easy access. We use it a few times a week in a multiple room loft area and it does a good job between full vacuuming on the weekend. You can easily schedule it, leave the house and have it clean up while you are away.  So far absoutely no issues, still cleaning as well as Day 1."
04/04/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it!,"We spent the first 30 minutes just watching it work!  Good to have to use on a daily basis, but there are some things it won't go under."
12/21/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Our 2nd Roomba,"We returned a roomba few years back because the brushes kept breaking, this one we purchased about two months back and brushes are holding strong!"
9/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Never thought I would love it!,"We recently had new flooring installed in two levels of our tri-level home (~1,500 sq ft):  living room, dining and kitchen are now dark wood plank LVT, lower level family room is dark LVT + large area rug. Upstairs is carpet in bedrooms/hallway, vinyl in bathrooms.  We originally had a mix of carpet and vinyl in the house (beige and light-medium oak parquet-look vinyl).My nightmare began with the new ""dark"" flooring.  It never looked clean with 3 adults in the house and 3 dogs (2 cocker spaniels and a cockapoo).  The dogs don't shed much but they are always bringing something in from the yard--leaves, grass, oak tree whirlybirds, dirt, mud etc (as is my spouse), and there is all the crumbs from normal cooking and eating etc.  I now needed to sweep/vacuum and/or wet/dry mop daily instead of once a week.  I first tried the Braava to dust mop the LVT.  The Braava did okay, but it got stuck a lot under several chairs that had rocker bases and the wet mop always had too much hair etc in it so I needed to dry dust mop once and wet mop the next even if I used my stick vac first.  I work outside the home at least 5 days a week, long hours and a long commute.  I didn't need this extra work.On the spur of the moment I decided to buy the Roomba 650 (or 655) at Costco as they had it on display.  I never thought I would buy a Roomba (or the Braava).  This has made life so much easier.  After less than a week (bought Sat), I have sent the Roomba on at least one mission each day.  On the main level daily, lower level once as a trial (LVT, area rug, scatter rug), and the upper level twice.  Now that I see what it can do and what needs to be watched, I'm ready to start using the schedule cycle for main level (Roomba base) when I get up in the AM (set for 4:00 am M-F, weekends later) and I'll manually set to do a clean in the other two levels alternating days.  The only time my Roomba has gotten stuck so far is at the stair transition and only the one time.  It doesn't like the scatter rug in the kitchen where the dog bowls are (it bunches it up, but doesn't get stuck). I knew enough going in that I had to do some preparation with cords etc.  When I replace the scatter rug, I'll be looking for one that's heavier and will work better with the Roomba. The scatter rug and area rug in the family room (lower level) didn't cause any problems.  I may be thinking of some different furniture placement so the Roomba can get into more areas of the family room.  Still working on the dining room for maximum efficiency, we have a pedestal table.  The Roomba can't get under the pedestal part as it's too low and if I straddle the chair's on the pedestal legs it takes a lot of time for it to work on that room.  Plan to try various ways to place the chairs (upside down on the tabletop, move between the table legs, move away from the table).  I will move the table and a few other furniture pieces around slightly a couple of times a week that are too low for the Roomba to get under.I still use the Braava, but now it's the default wet mop several times a week in the evening as it needs to be babysat.I think I have the perfect pair now."
11/23/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Adorable time saver,"We received this product as part of our Amazon wedding registry and he's honestly become my favorite gift. My wife immediately named him ""Mr. Bumble"" and it's fitting. He's not only black and yellow but also bumbles around adorably vacuuming the house. We have an open floor plan so it's pretty easy for him to go around our first floor cleaning the kitchen, living room, and mud room.We love cooking but don't always like having to sweep up after every night's errant bits/crumbs. Mr. Bumble manages to keep things very tidy by regularly vacuuming without us needing to do much more than spend 2 minutes moving our coffee table more into the open to clear the way, empty his bin, and hit the ""clean"" button.Pros:Handles carpet transition wellrelatively quietautomatic schedulingdoes his thing and has thus far always managed to get back to his dock to recharge without any helpdumping out the bin is quick and painlessVery little ""tidying"" required before he runsEdit: I've added some pictures of how much debris the little fellow can pick up on one run through what looked like a relatively clean areaCons:Suction power is a little lower than idealsometimes misses a few small bits in one pass (although he seems to compensate by getting things on a second pass/run)One does have to dump out the bin occasionally and move a few things out of the way to ensure a good cleaningWe love the little fellow and if you think you'd benefit from some easy regular maintenance cleaning then we'd highly recommend this Roomba."
11/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,still a game changer,"We received this as a gift and I am thinking about getting it for my father-in-law so was humoring myself reading the reviews. I have started to take it for granted but when we first got it, I loved it SO much I thought we should name it like a pet. I still love it. We have stopped vacuuming in the traditional sense we have a large dog and 2 boys and I can't even imagine the apocalyptic nastiness that would commence without this device. That being saidIT IS indeed a vacuum cleaner.... so anything you would have to do to prepare to run a vacuum you have to do with this thing... picking up large debris such as discarded socks etc. We habitually put our chairs up on the table like a restaurant at the end of the day when this thing is running you don't have to do that but it super annoying to watch it navigate 16 chair legs. Actually I never thought to put my chairs up before before I moved them out of the room... definitely a better way to clean your floors with or without this thing. We got this last year and have run it daily since then I would say we are a heavy traffic family and not super diligent with maintenance beyond just cleaning the trap daily and occasionally removing obstructions like plastic or string and it still does a great job. The only caveat I can think of: We have hardwood floor or tile throughout we have several area rugs and one that has a large black border and black throughoutthis thing will not work on itit sees black as a drop off which prevents it from going down stairs etc. so we manually vacuum that particular rugper the Internet I have tried taping the sensors etc but that does not work. it's still genius on anything that is not black."
1/28/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it,We received ours just before Christmas about 2 months ago and really like it so far.  With a dog a couple of cats and a kid it really keeps up with the hair on the floor allowing us to sweep 1 time/week in the hard to reach areas instead of the entire floor daily.  We have wood and tile throughout with a few area rugs and it seems to deal well with all surfaces.  I can't believe that the bin fills up every single day so make sure you keep it dumped and maybe use the regular vacuum to clean the filter a couple of times a week.  Ours must have been on sale because we paid much less than the $399 it advirtized at now.
10/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Battery charging,"We received our iRobot in late July. It worked wonderfully until 2 weeks ago and quit charging, Ant suggestions??"
12/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We really like that it can run on a schedule,We really like that it can run on a schedule. We have it run while we're at work so we don't have to hear or avoid it. When we come home we empty the bin and it's ready for the next scheduled run. Our home is fairly large so we use the included virtual wall to split it's duty cycle. This little guy has no problem cleaning each side of the house on a single charge.
11/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We love our Roomba 650!,"We read tons of reviews before buying our Roomba 650 Vacuum. I was a big skeptic. BUT now I'm a believer and obsessed with our Roomba! It can travel over rugs, hardwood, and door frames no problem! It goes all around and really does vacuum up a lot!! The best part is is that it saves me so much time because I don't have to vacuum!"
11/24/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Did not perform as expected with pet hair/,"We purchased this unit specifically because it claimed it was for pet hair.  It did not meet our expectations.  We have a combination of wood floors and low rugs.  The unit did well navigating the rooms and was able to vaccum the pet hair in modest amounts.  It vacuumed best when the hair was in the middle of the room and of light quantity.  However, it did very poorly when the hair was around the edges of the room near walls and doors.  It was at its worst when the hair was next to rugs.  It seemed if there was any tension keeping the hair to the rug or other object, the unit could not pull and vacuum the hair.  In hindsight we probably should not have been surprised.  The unit does not have the power of a regular vacuum cleaner and one should not expect it to perform as well.  We didn't expect to be able to get rid of our normal vacuum cleaner but wanted to keep things a bit more tidy in between big cleanings. This unit did not meet that need.  Finally, even if it performed as marketed, the unit takes an excessive amount of time to clean just one room-- not to mention multiple.  While the noise of the unit isn't bad, it is not something you want to hear for hours.  Some would argue that one should turn the unit on when you leave the house, which would be logical.  However, this is not practical given the unit will always shut down at some point and request that the sensor be cleaned and the bumpers cleared."
8/30/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,AMAZING!,"We purchased this Roomba on Friday at Best Buy! We have named him Walle! This little guy is the best thing to come into my life, the setup is pretty simple, you have to leave it charged overnight at first. The next day we turned it on and after about 30 minutes I did have to empty, but please note I never swept my house so it was a dirty, but you could see the difference! The best part about this guy is he's able to go under your couch/bed/or hard to reach places, which is a huge bonus! I don't know how he would work with carpet, but he has some really great wheels, so it shouldn't be a problem. Honestly, the only thing I could complain is that it didn't also Mop the floors as well."
12/21/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Totally worth the money,"We purchased this in the summer of this year. We have it set to run everyday. Our house is wood flooring, and we have two cats. This picks up litter, the little pet hair ""tumbleweeds"" and other little bits of dust and debris on the floor. You just have to remember to empty the container each day at first. When it first starts cleaning, you will amazed at what you haven't seen on your floor. It does not clean the whole house each time: one day it will do one area (living room, bedroom, hallways) then the next day it seems to go in another direction (kitchen, dining, master bedroom), which is fine with me, we don't need all over daily cleaning."
3/20/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Best money I ever spent,"We purchased the Roomba 650 to handle day-to-day cleaning of hardwood floors.  Not only has the Roomba far exceeded our expectations for the hardwoods, it has also exceeded them on carpet.You know the Roomba is working because you will need to repeatedly empty the bin to toss all the debris it picks up from the floor.  We set it loose in a master bedroom, and within an hour we had perfectly clean carpet, that was fluffy and soft to the touch, even under the bed.  There is nothing better than watching a robot do your housework for you, in fact, I coined a term to describe the feeling, and it is ""housegasm.""I cannot recommend the Roomba 650 highly enough.  We have two small puppies who shed hair; the Roomba gets it all.  We live in the Pacific Northwest and cannot help tracking pine needles into the house; the Roomba gets them all.Coming home to clean floors every day is a great feeling.  Thank you Roomba 650!"
1/20/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Better than doing it yourself.  Better than paying for a cleaning person.,"We purchased our iRobot Roomba 650 about a 6 weeks ago.  My husband and I are transitioning to our second home, so our primary residence was looking a bit dusty due to my lack of time there.  I decided we either needed a cleaning company or a Roomba.  So far, it has been really helping us keep our place looking neat and tidy.  True, it doesn't clean stairs )-: or get into the corners, but if used as a twice weekly touch up after a great cleaning, it is amazing how good it works.  I didn't expect much and told my husband to use it as much as possible when he was there in case it was a bust and died after a few uses, but so far so good. I think the way to use this is to move things like cords away from the floor and it will be smooth sailing.  During Christmas, it kept knocking our candles off the windows until we raised them a little.  It just makes it easier than getting an error message.  I have not noticed any marks on furniture or woodwork, but I will look for that.  I think a flannel bumper should be included on the Roomba if people are having damage.  Wouldn't it be wise for the company to eliminate this problem.  Now hoping it has a long life.  I will try to remember to update in a few years if it is still working.  I have had many brands and other than my current vacuum, my experience is that they have a very short life.Pros:  I don't have to spend all my time at my temporary residence making up for being away so much.  I can do other things while it is vacuuming.  It can be programmed.  It is very small and you can even hide it under furniture if you want to.  It does a great job on wood, carpets and tile so far.Cons: Noisy, but no where near as noisy as my regular vacuum cleaner; not even close.  Doesn't do stairs or corners.  It can get stuck under things even though it got in there in the first place.  It must be cleaned after every use or I see a short life."
10/27/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Not just an indulgence...,"We owned a Roomba when they first came out, and it was a disappointment.  We spent more time cleaning the Roomba than the Roomba cleaned our floor.  This one is a treat.We set it to go at our hallway and laundry room floor tile. In about 20 minutes, the dustbin was completely full of dog hair and dust.  Roomba is superior to a broom in the amount of dust that it picks up.We were absolutely amazed each time we set it to vacuum up a different room in our house.  When Roomba is finished, the floors are definitely cleaner than when I use a traditional vacuum, or sweep the tile with a broom.The downside to this little guy is that we have women with long hair in our house, and the long hair gets wrapped around the parts.  About every fifth time, we end up having to use scissors to clean out the roller balls and the cleaning brushes.This is time well spent each time I see how much ""yuck"" is in the little dust bin.  This product is not an indulgence for people with allergies and/or pets, it's worth the investment."
12/28/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Woodhouse - Highly Recommended,"We named our Roomba 650 Woodhouse, after the butler in Archer (Spot was a close second in the voting).With a few reservations, buying a Roomba may have been one of the best purchases I have ever made, the house is much more free of dust, dirt, and hair than any other place I have lived before, and with little to no effort on my part.While Woodhouse does not get every last spec of dust and dirt in the whole house, he does an excellent job getting almost every one. Almost as important as the cleanliness is the entertainment of watching him work his way through the house, around (and sometimes trying to go through) furniture. I glued two googly eyes to his top, creating a smiling face with a bulbous nose which just adds to his drunken clown-like behavior.The best part is that, if we don't want him underfoot, we can schedule him to run as many times per week as we want, and we come home from work to a clean home (we joke about him cleaning the windows and counters, but he never gets there).My reservations:His erratic path does sometimes miss obvious dirt, which can either be spot cleaned or leftThe sensors are REALLY bad at seeing dark-colored furniture, a few of our pieces have small dents around the legs where he rammed into them full speed (versus slowing down, like with walls)He seems to clean certain rooms more and more completely than others, this may be due to the path he chooseHe gets stuck on thick rugs and our bathroom scale and can't always get offThe cord detect only works half the time, usually once a week we come home to find him choking on a phone charger (our fault for leaving it around, probably)Either way, I love Woodhouse so much that I bring him to my family's home (they have four dogs) where he does quick work of the dander and pet hair. This Roomba was a great purchase, and has saved me countless hours of vacuuming, more than paying for itself. We have no pets in our ~1000 sqft apartment (which he has no problem covering), but we bought this version for the better ratings and durability, and it seems to have been a good decision."
06/02/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great product,"We made the decision to rearrange our house slightly to maximize the ability of the Roomba to do its thing without getting stuck. Since then, its been a dream. Picks up a lot better than I expected, too."
5/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,Worked great and now won't hold charge more than a few minutes,"We loved this at the beginning. NOW 5.5 months later it is not holding its charge. It will run a few minutes and say it needs to be charged. I have kept it clean, re set it, charged it for extended time. I am calling Roomba and seeing if the 1 year warranty will hold true since we bought it here on Amazon. I just want it repaired. I miss Rosie. That is our name for our Roomba."
12/26/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,We love this thing. Will never sweep with a broom again
11/06/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Does a great job... maybe too great...,"We love this Roomba.  Our only complaint is due to our time constraints.  We have 3 dogs... so lots of dog hair.  We figured if we run this every night... then it could keep up.  But, due to the fact that it is very thorough... it takes us about 10 minutes to clean all the dog hair out of the rollers before we can use it again.  Consequently, we get ready to go to bed... then think about starting up the Roomba and inevitably... we both say ""I'll clean it tomorrow""... but tomorrow never comes.So... if you have animals... expect to have to clean it often.  Other than that... it does a great job!!"
5/19/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We love this vacuum!,We love this robot!  We call her Sweetie and we make her go to work every day. Set up an automatic schedule and your house always looks great
07/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Good little helper,"We love this little guy. We call him ""Lil Fella"".  I am a working mom and even right after I vacuum the floor start looking crappy again. My family is messy. I turn this guy on and he makes life easier.  Sometimes he gets stuck somewhere. Like just wiggles himself on top of something and he can't escape. If you're home you can hear him struggling and we just say ""you need help little fella?"" and move him a few inches over.  He doesn't always make it back  to my bedroom so I just put him in and  close the door and voila. He gets to every little but he can.  He is too tall to go under my dressers. We had a Neato for a second-  it would go under but in general it wasn't very good and then a week in it stopped charging. The Roomba also isn't very loud- WAAAY quieter than the Neato and quieter than my upright. He doesn't even scare the cat.Now I will say if you think this will completely replace your cleaning efforts, it won't. And if you expect him to never get  stuck and work when you're away and you never touch him, that's not realistic.  But for the price he makes my life a little easier and for that I thank him. Thanks Lil Fella!"
11/29/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Good little robot,"We love the scheduling ability of the Roomba - we set it to run every roughly every other night after we go to bed. It's about as loud as a hand-vac sitting on a remote-controlled car. When it's a floor below us, we can hear it, but it doesn't keep us awake. When it runs in the basement, we can't even hear it. It does miss spots on any given run, because it runs so frequently, it continues to keep the floor clean. It handles hard wood floors, rugs, and carpets equally well, and even does a good job getting under our couch. Occasionally we wake up to find that it's gotten tangled in something we didn't know was there, but it generally does a good job avoiding obstacles. It's easy to clean - everything you might want to remove or open is marked in yellow (except the big button to remove the trash bin), which makes it pretty easy to remember how to clean it."
8/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We love the Roomba 650,"We love the Roomba 650.  We have several dogs in the house and one has fairly long hair.  The Roomba does a great job of collecting the hair and dirt off of ceramic tile and sculpted carpet. We have found that for best results, clean the dirt trap and the roller brushes after each use and it's always ready to go the next time.  Cleaning the roller brushes is a little tedious, but they send a great little tool that helps you tackle this task in an efficient manner.  I wish I had ordered one sooner."

3/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We love our roomba,"We love our roomba. Just need to get better about leaving things on the floor now.We had a $600 Miele vacuum before it and now we hardly ever have to use it. Really just for the stairs.I've thought about getting one for the downstairs but really it's not that hard to bring it downstairs every week or so.I would like to keep my place super clean on a weekly basis. I don't have a ton of time with my work and I'm thinking about hiring a cleaner. It'd be awesome if there were just robots to do everything around the house, but the vacuum is a really sweet start."
10/31/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,You NEED this!!,We love our little Roomba. We nick named it R2D2. It's amazing how much pet hair and dirt gets sucked up by this thing. We have 2 cats and a dog so there is plenty of pet hair!  The cats were afraid of it at first but now they just steer clear of it when it is running. We give it 5 stars!!!!

4/24/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We love Roomba!,We love it! I will say it sat in a box for almost 9 months unopened because I wasn't ready to give up control. But once my 5 year old begged me to see the Robot and promised to pick up her toys better I caved and there's no turning back! Cat wasn't freaked by it. It sucks up a ton of cat hair too and ours is a Maine Coon. I like to set it to clean when I'm ready as opposed to the scheduled method. So far so good!

When we go out for an hour or more we simply unleash this robot and return to a clean floor.  It finds it's charger and returns home perfectly.  We love this unit."
6/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love this little guy!  Spread out rooms are not a problem.,"We live in a condo with multiple rooms spanning a pretty large distance. In total, it is two bathrooms, two bedrooms a long hall and a closet.  The distance from the Roomba home base to the farthest room is about 70 feet. All hardwood floors.  I was concerned that Roomba would not make it to the far end room without losing signal or running out of battery. My fears were unfounded.  The Roomba has been operating for two weeks with no problems. Every day it cleans every single room, then returns to it's home base with no problem at all. It has also not fallen down the stairs to the lower level.We also have two places where there is a raised transition strip to a different flooring material (tile in bathrooms).  I was concerned that Roomba would high center on these strips or see them as a wall and not continue into the bathrooms. This has not been a problem. Roomba just rolls right over and cleans those bathrooms like a champ.My wife, who typically does the vacuuming  (she is retired while I am not) thanks me daily. No more vacuuming!"
3/24/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I feel it is a tad overpriced but we are quite happy with it,"We just got tile flooring. I was sweeping 2-3x a day due to dogs. I haven't had to sweep once since getting the roomba. It is scheduled to go out once a day and every couple of days I will run it a 2nd time. The debris container is always full. The only complaint I have however is, it says it won't get caught up on wires or rugs etc but that is untrue. It does. A lot I might add. Even flat type rugs. I constant find it in *error* on the mat by the back door and that is actually very thin. I feel it is a tad overpriced but we are quite happy with it."
11/16/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Fights Fur Furiously,"We just got ourÊiRobot Roomba 650 Vacuum Cleaning Robot for Pets.  It was simple to setup and charged in about two hours.  We have run it once downstairs and upstairs.THE PLANThe plan is to run it during the day upstairs and to run it at night downstairs.  The first problem we noted is that the schedule only seems to allow one time per day.  This is ok since we have to carry it upstairs for the day runs.  So, we just start it as we live in the morning.  When we return, we put on the charger and let it clean at 2AM downstairs.OBSERVATIONSThe upstairs (approx. 1000 sqft) is a combination of wood floors, tile in the bathrooms, scatter rugs (bath style and oriental).  Roomba did a good job covering an awkward area.  We captured a full bin of hair from the dogs.  The only problem is that it got caught in the toilet area after it managed to close the door on itself.  It found out that it was too short to reach the handle to reopen the door.  Roomba was able to clean under the bed and sofa.  However, it was unable to get under the night stands and dressers.  This was unfortunate because the floor and fur is still very visible.  (We will have to consider replacing the furniture that we bought a month ago.  I can see it is going to be a pain to clean under whether we have Roomba or not).The downstairs (approx. 800 sqft) is all tile with scatter rugs (bath, entry and orientals).  Roomba was able to get under the counters in the kitchen, under the sofa, the dining room chairs.  Once again we captured a full bin of fur. Downstairs we had a few problems.  Roomba managed to catch itself on a rug.  Roomba announced that it needed help.  It was also able to move a very light side table and an empty plastic dog dish.  The bin was full of fur and even captured some large dog food nuggets.  Roomba was also able to maneuver through electrical cords.  We did absolutely no preparations before starting Roomba.LIMITATIONSRoomba does not do windows, stairs and areas that are shorter than itself.INITIAL CONCLUSIONSWe are pleased so far.  The machine does a good job collecting fur in open areas and low areas that are taller than Roomba.  We will have to consider how to handle the light furniture and lighter carpets.  We will also have to determine how to ensure that open doors stay open if we want it to roam unrestricted.If you are a micro manager, you will have problems with how Roomba gets the job done.  If you are results  driven manager, you will find that the Roomba does a good job.  It gets where it is designed to get, and it does a thorough job.  Roomba does its job.  Don't worry about how it does it.ONE WEEK CONCLUSIONS (11/23/2012)Roomba has been busy.  We run it about 8 hours per day.  We collect 4 full bins of fur every day!  Neither my wife  nor I imagined how much fur our dogs generated.  We just moved from a home that was primarily carpeted to hard surfaces.  It is not like they are big dogs.  We regularly strip our dogs (pull fur  with a comb).  We are more than both pleased by the purchase.  Even if we had a maid, we would still run Roomba regularly.  I don't think a daily maid service could keep up with Roomba's vacuuming or our dogs fur production.  It (or perhaps I should say we) does occasionally make a mistake.  It has eaten two usb cords and a couple of loose threads on some oriental carpets.THIRD MONTH CONCLUSIONS (2/15/2013)Roomba has not been needed as much.  I would guess he gets about three hours of work a day.  Once a day downstairs and twice a day upstairs.  My wife and I agree that it has been a good purchase.  Two unexpected consequences: our HVAC filters stay clean much longer and dusting need not happen as frequently. Roomba looks a little battle worn with superficial scrapes.  However, the battery is still going strong.  We spend almost no maintenance time.  Every time we move Roomba, we empty the bin.  We have had to do some major maintenance (more than five minutes) a couple of times.  Long hair seems to collect and requires a careful unwinding.  (We are all short haired except my daughter who visited at Christmas).  The filter requires a little cleaning for optimal efficiency.  Sometimes Roomba decides to complete the job under the bed or under a sofa.  So, I have to call her.  She is about as good as our deaf dog about coming when called.  If we confined her to a single room, she would be much easier to find.  She is infatuated with bathrooms.  She still forgets that she can not reach the handle to open the door after she closes it.  We try to remember to close the bathrooms before she begins her work.FOURTH MONTH Conclusions (3/6/2013)Roomba has taken a beating over these four months.  She has lots of scratches.  We have lost our edge second whisker.  I bought one of the replacement packs with filters, brushes, rollers.  The battery is still going strong.  Roomba is getting a little senile.  She'll drop her dust bin and keep going.  So, she is just sweeping around dust.  I think we need to do a thorough cleaning to make sure the latches catch properly.  We are still very happy, and our house stays much cleaner.NINTH MONTH Conclusions (7/31/2013)Should Roomba die after the end of the warranty period, we would buy one again.  I would be disappointed, but we could not live without it.  If anything it is more important than ever, one of our dogs has Cushings and loses fur by the handful."
08/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Absolutely life changing (and that is not hyperbole!),"We have used this probably 10 times in the last 3 days, and it's just really fun to watch because it is so intuitive! Now we do have a great pet vacuum, and we thought our floors were really clean after we vacuumed and mopped. Holy crap, we were SO wrong. This little monster has crazy suction power, it gets in ALLLLL the nooks and crannies that we can never reach, and it gets under all the things I didn't think it would fit under. Our floors and baseboards have NEVER been cleaner, and our cat and dog shed a LOT! It also easily transitions from carpets to linoleum to tile to laminate, and it adjusts its brushes and such accordingly. Honestly, our carpets have never even looked this clean.We don't need to worry about it damaging the legs of chairs or tables, etc., it detects it fast enough that it slows down and maneuvers around them like a pro. When it hits something, the tap is light enough and the Roomba material is ""soft"" enough that it doesn't hurt anything.We have cords and cables everywhere. Small ones, big ones, they are everywhere. This is the one thing I was pretty worried about. The detection on this thing is amazing. It will go over cords, all of them, but it detects them immediately and it will stop turning its brushes so it doesn't get it tangled, and it was roll on, sucking things up without rotating the brush. The other cool thing that I keep seeing is that when it does get wrapped up in a cord, it untangles itself by swinging around in the opposite direction. It's so cool. It won't pick up a sock, or a spoon or anything like that that might be accidentally left on the floor.Since these last few days have been the first time our floors have gotten a deep and thorough cleaning, we have had to empty the dustbin many, many times, but it takes literally 5 seconds. It could not be easier to pause Roomba and empty quickly, and then let it continue on. It picks up so much of my own hair that we need to clean the brush every cycle as well, but it's as easy as, or easier, than cleaning hair out of a hair brush. It's completely low maintenance and I am super lazy!I don't really understand how anyone can complain about the noise. I would say it's somewhere between a full-size vacuum and a box fan on high, although to me, it is closer to the sound of a box fan on high. I also get annoyed with noisy things and this little thing isn't annoying. It's more white noise than anything, unless it is repeatedly running into things and getting tangled up.I haven't tried the scheduling feature yet, but I plan to, as soon as the dog understands it is not a toy for her. I plan to update in a year or so. All the parts (no, seriously, ALL the parts) are replaceable. We could replace parts year after year and keep it alive for many years. When he finally dies though, I can promise we will immediately buy another. For someone with terrible, awful, no good, very bad allergies, this little birthday gift is life changing!"
8/24/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great help around this busy doggy household,"We have used this little guy several times a week for almost 2 years and it still tackles the massive amounts of pet fur with no problem!  It did get stuck under the fridge a couple times, but it knows to shut itself off. Periodically blowing out the filters with an air compressor greatly extends their life span and saves $."
01/06/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Best invention, ever.","We have two short haired dogs that shed like crazy. We have a light tile downstairs, and both dogs are white/cream so it's hard to see their hair, but you know it's there. I hated walking barefoot or in socks downstairs because I could either feel the hair/dirt on the floor or it would be stuck to my socks. I had a hard floor vacuum that I tried to use a couple times a week, but I didn't always have time.We got a Roomba for Christmas and I couldn't be happier!! We programmed it to automatically clean every night after we go to bed. It takes off, cleans the entire downstairs, and puts itself back on the base to charge when it is done. In the morning I just get up and empty it out (which takes about 10 seconds) and now I don't have to worry about cleaning the floor! Aside from mopping, but I would rather mop once a week then have to constantly vacuum the floor plus mop.We have used it in the day when we are home, but it is a bit loud. Not unbearably loud, but we just prefer it cleans when we are upstairs sleeping.Programming the unit is incredibly easy and cleaning it is as well. It also comes with a sensor that can be used to create a ""wall"" if you don't want it to clean in a certain area. We set it up by our dining room table because it goes under there and gets stuck like it's trapped in a pinball game. I highly recommend this product!"
9/27/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great for everyday use,"We have two rather large dogs and use this everyday. We move it around all three floors of our house and it works perfectly. Moves from hardwood to carpet with no issues. Does a great job, but obviously doesn't get everything that your normal vacuum wouldn't either. Maybe once a week we have to do a light sweep to get the rest, but it's great at getting into corners and picking up everything on it's own. It is fairly loud (like most vacuums), so don't plan on scheduling this to run overnight, as it's probably to loud to do so."
12/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,What did I do with you Roomba 650?,"We have two large dogs, a large cat and a toddler. We also have a backyard that has more dirt than grass.  Basically if we don't vacuum daily there is hair and dust everywhere. For a time I said I'd vacuum daily and keep up with it all, and I did.  The house was clean, we felt good.  But then I got tired of doing it.  Work got in the way.  Our daughter got older and more engergetic.  So I would avoid vacuuming for a few days, maybe a week, and hair would be EVERYWHERE.Enter the Roomba 650 (or Bobo the Robo as my daughter calls him), and the house is clean again!  I'm constantly amazed by the job this robot does.  I turn him on when I'm working from home or if I went to work that day, when I'm making dinner.  Bobo sets off on his merry way and gets all the dog hair.  He actually probably does a better job than I do, because he goes over the same spots multiple times.  I'm amazed at the stuff he finds even when the floor doesn't look dirty.Overall this thing has been a great quality of life enhancement.  I no longer worry about the hair.  No longer have to deal with my daughter getting covered in dog hair when she decides to roll on the floor.  Love this thing and wish I bought one earlier!"
11/30/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Dog hair is up!,We have two bully breeds that shed like crazy and track in dirt and plant matter. We've been running this thing once a day. I can walk around on my hard floors without putting flip flops on . . . Life changed.
11/30/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,... have three dogs in the house and this does amazing at keeping up with the hair,"We have three dogs in the house and this does amazing at keeping up with the hair. It is pretty loud, so I always schedule it to run while we are at work. Also, the brushes get pretty covered relatively fast. I clean them every other day or so. Regardless, I am very happy with the purchase."
11/18/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We like it!,"We have the iRobot for few days and it is working constantly. It's great to pick up everything from the floor and then just let it work until the battery is empty. It can work about an hour and it covers most areas in the room or floor. We used it in both floors and it's working great. It was also very easy to operate the first time, just remove the battery protection, first charge over night - and start working the next day. This innovation is really awesome!"
03/05/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great floor cleaning assistant.,"We have owned this vacuum for a about a week and I'm impressed. We love the scheduled cleaning (set for midnight every night).  I would not have this as my only vacuum, it is great as an in-between maintenance tool. It has only gotten stuck once.  If you use this as a helper it will you keep your place looking pristine."
04/10/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Wonderful!,"We have mostly hardwood floors with scatter rugs and this does an amazing job!  We have 2 dogs and 2 cats, no more tumble weeds of hair!  We used to heavy vac every weekend with spot cleanings in between.  Now we run the roomba every few days and have never felt cleaner.  Easy use, thorough and easy to maintain.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase!"
11/14/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Cheap and reliable,"We have just this robot vacuum cleaner for two months and compared it to the Roomba 880 and Miele Scout RX1 models (much more expensive models).Cons:- The brush design is so that if having pets as dogs or cats it gets filtered and needs constantly removal of hair. The 880 model is much, much better for pet hairs due to a very different main brush design (plastic tube)- Its noisy!- It uses long time for cleaning, often with problems locating the base station.- It may be programmed, but this is just repeating the same time each day. It is not possible to differentiate between days.Pros:- Relatively cheap- Does not have the charging problems or other major issues identified with the Miele and 880 model.- The Roomba room division/area system is working wellOverall, this model is suited for cleaning when out of home (noise/time) if not having pets. It seem reliable and works without major issues. Good value for money, but the location/pattern system and noise level is not up to the standard of the best robot vacuum cleaners."
4/24/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"well worth the money, can't wait for more robotic domestic help!","We have hardwood floors, some rugs, and a dog. Very open plan, 1 floor, 2000sqft. But this thing picks up all the dust bunnies before they form! Forces you to keep the floor tidy too!Great stuff. Love it. Makes the place look civilised again.First, have a good vacuuming. Then use this little 'bot little and often. Going to the store? Roomba! Having a nice shower?... the amount of stuff it picks up every day is amazing. No shit.Based on this, I'm looking forward to a lot more robotic domestic help.Downside? Well, it can get 'stuck' if your house is full of little spaces I guess, and you need to have all your crap off the floor, obviously. But the amount of pet hair it gets alone is worth the effort. And you need to remember to use it initially. Haven't tried auto timed cleaning yet, but if you made sure the place was ready, great."
8/21/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Can't imagine not having Roomba!,"We have had Roomba for about 1-1/2 years now, and I can't imagine not having it. While it doesn't vacuum along edges or in tight areas very well, it does a great job everywhere else. We have a cat, and when we shut off Roomba during vacation, we realize how much we need it once we return. It picks up pet hair really well. It works on both tile and carpet. The ball on the bottom broke a few weeks ago, but we were able to get a quick replacement from iRobot for about $6. A couple of the parts are a little difficult to clean because they don't come apart well enough to get all the hair out, but the rest is easy to clean. Overall, I would highly recommend this to everyone, especially pet owners who are sick of finding clumps of fur all over the floor even after they've just vacuumed the day before."
11/30/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Alfred gets the job done!,"We have had our Roomba for about a month now and I can't remember life without it.  We have a shetland sheepdog that sheds and the amount of hair in our house since ""Alfred"" started with us has been reduced drastically.  Every once in a while Alfred will get trapped somewhere but it hasn't been a big deal for us.  The only thing I really dislike is having to clean the brush. Our dog has longer hair so it gets tangled up easy..this had to be done with our old vacuum as well. We have it scheduled to run while we are gone during the day and we move it upstairs and back downstairs every few days. I try not to watch Alfred work because it can be quite annoying seeing him going for a speck on the floor only to have him turn away at the last minute.  He gets to it eventually though and all is well.  The virtually wall has worked well for us when we use it. My only complaint is that I didn't get one sooner!"
1/20/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,So awesome!,"We have had our Roomba for a month now and couldn't be happier. We have little kids, which leads to a lot of crumbs on the rug in the living room and under the dining room table. Well, not any more! Thanks Rooba! This little robot friend is programmed to come on at 10 every morning and clean up, and it does a great job. Also, being able to threaten the kids with, ""if you don't pick up your toys, the robot is going to eat them,"" works like a charm!"
06/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Pets make Roomba a necessity.,"We have four cats and mostly laminate floors, and Roomba has become absolutely indispensable in the 10 months we've had it. Our cats shed so much that I used to have to sweep the house daily, but now I just set Roomba to run every morning and empty it out every couple days. It works better on the laminate than on the carpet, but it still works great either way. It's surprising how much stuff this little dude picks up. However, I wish it would stop vacuuming up cat barf. It doesn't seem to spread it across the house like one reviewer said, but it does get the puke all over the undercarriage, which is unpleasant to clean. I'm happy to clean dried puke out of Roomba once a week rather than sweep daily. The only real problem we've had is that the motor (presumably) for the side brush has recently stopped working. Roomba is definitely less effective without this brush, as it is what allows the robot to clean corners and along walls. It's better than nothing, but I'll be contacting iRobot support to resolve the issue. My aunt has had the same issue with her Roomba (she has a fancier model), but her brush stopped working after just a few weeks."
12/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I persisted in search of a work around and glad to say I found it online,We have designer carpet with black stripes and squares ........ our Roomba 650 kept stopping. I persisted in search of a work around and glad to say I found it online. Cover the four sensors with gloss photo paper with the gloss facing the lights to reflect it back and make it think it's working. Just tape the photo paper in place. This disables the lights that detect stairs ..... we have no stairs so it can't tumble down. You can use your electronic barrier for this. Lots of things work as a barrier. A lot of people are ready to send their Roomba back but this is all you have to do. This is a fine machine but users have to take things into their own hands sometimes.
7/30/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Really Good Robot Cleaner,We have been using the Roomba 650 now since I bought it for my wife for Christmas and the little robot is still chugging away and cleaning our floors.  And with three cats in our house I can assure you it does do a good job getting up most of the cat hair. So far no complaints.
8/26/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great product.  Great value.,"We have been using the Roomba 650 for about a month now.  Rosie, as we call her, is programmed to run 5 days a week while we are at work.  Also run sometimes on the weekend.  The only reason she does not get 5 stars is that is does not get into corners, but still well worth the money.  We have a Great Pyrenees that sheds like crazy and so it keeps the hair picked up on a daily basis.  Our main living area is all on one floor, so she cleans the entire floor (living room, dining room, kitchen, bedroom and 2 bathrooms). She does have to be cleaned everyday.  The areas that need to be cleaned are bright yellow, so it is easy to flip her over and clean the wheels and brushes.  Definitely recommend the Roomba 650."
12/29/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,We have an open architecture. Roomba is having trouble ...,We have an open architecture. Roomba is having trouble learning it. Not all areas are getting covered and it is also getting stuck.
3/18/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Meets realistic expectations,"We have an 1800 SqFt house over 3 floors.  The Roomba is used on at least one floor each day.  It will NOT replace your vacuum but it will cut at least in half the amount of times you will need to run the big one (the canister on the big one is not as full as it used to be either).  Every week or so, I need to clean my wife's hair out of the brush along with the other strings and whatnot that get tangled around it. Other than that it seems to be doing a great job, it keeps up with the dog hair and the crumbs the baby drops on the floor.  Again, have realistic expections; this is not a Bissel or a Dyson but it will make their jobs a bit easier just the same."
3/31/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,My house always looks vacuumed now,"We have a bassett hound as an indoor dog and that means dog hair EVERYWHERE. We constantly battle to keep the carpet relatively clean on hair but what meant vacuuming every day. With the Roomba 650 we wake every morning to a freshly vacuumed family room. I recommend buying the recplacement filter/brush set. We have to clean the roller brushes every few days and also swap the filter every morning (cleaning the used on under running water). If we do not clean the filter, by the third day the unit is putting so much dust and dander in the air when it runs that it feels like I have buried my nose in a severe allergen and taken a deep breath.My main compaint has to be the once a day scheduling limit. After about a month I still find myself running the Roomba several times a day because I like the living area of the house to always look like showroom floors. I wish I could have it run ever 6 hours automatically."
4/30/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Couldn't live without it,"We have 4 dogs and a cat and used clean the floors every day and still couldn't get the hair issue under control. I would sweep and vacuum daily spending hours a week. We got the Roomba thinking it may be more of a novelty item, but after reading the reviews we had to try it out. Wow! It cleans under the couches, beds, and around the legs of the chairs and furniture better than I could with the hardwood floor vacuum. Before the Roomba purchase you would walk around in socks and always end up with pet hair stuck on them which would of course make there way into your shoes or on the couches. That does not happen anymore. The floors always look spotless like we don't even have pets. Another reviewer said that they still had to vacuum once a week. We haven't had to vacuum once since we got the Roomba. Now that we have had one I don't think we could ever be without it. It has truly saved us from a constant battle with pet hair!"
6/26/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it!,We have 3 small animals and hardwood/tile flooring so there were dust bunnies all over. Now our roomba runs while we're at work and we come home to a clean house! It's crazy how much hair dust and dirt it picks up on a daily basis. It moves easily over all our area rugs and door mats. Highly recommend it :)
8/29/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,good on hard floors,"We have 2000+ sq ft of tile and wood laminate. With four cats the Roomba 650 does a good job of managing the shedding. We run it one to two times each day and it is full of fur.It is not good when it comes to short-pile entrance rugs. It turns around when it encounters them or shuts down if it manages to get onto the rug. Again, this is short pile.If you have hard surface floors it should do well, but not on carpets."
07/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Disappointed in this little fella,We had the Neato vacuum a couple years ago and after the battery ran out we decided to give this one a try. In comparison this one is terrible! It makes the floors look like my 1 year old got ahold of the vacuum if it even gets that far! It goes in circles and gets stuck in corners (on nothing!!) the Neato would go in straight lines and make the carpet look so nice! I also dropped some bread crumbs on the tile to see if this vacuum could pick it up and it didn't so not sure if it even actually works on hard surfaces. Will definitely go back to the Neato when we repurchase.
02/04/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing,"We got the Roomba as a xmas gift but it was from Bed Bath and Beyond.  It was purchased there because I highly anticipated that it would need to be returned after one use.  Well I couldn't have been more wrong.  It picked up everything in it's path... we have lots of dog hair especially under things. It goes up and over my kitchen sink mat and my rugs/ hard wood floors. It did got stuck on our bathroom rug but unstuck itself but then it kept getting re-stuck so I moved it.  It is a typical thin bath floor mat.  How well the Roomba works really depends on the setup in your house but it's totally worth the money if it does. I read tons of reviews on Amazon before getting it. It amazes me how well it does at getting under furniture. My mom said my house never looked cleaner. The best part is it has a scheduler so you can set it to vacuum while your gone and come home to a clean house  I imagine we will still need to use the big vacuum once and awhile for areas the Roomba missed.Pros --Cleans house for you-Has a scheduler that you can set to turn on automatically at a certain time/days-Returns to its base when the compartment needs to be emptied or when battery runs low-Very powerful and intuitive at moving around the house and over/under rugs furniture and doorways-Easy to use and empty-Base can be stored under furniture to remain out of sight when not in use-Virtual wall works well if you want to contain Roomba to one roomCons-(These cons should not deter you, they are merely an observation of things that could be better.  I mean, it cleans your floors for you.  Enough said)-Takes a long time to cover every square inch of the room-Compartment fills quickly and needs to be emptied often (this also means it's working!)-Battery life could be longer-You have to clear your floors of anything that could interfere such as cords or long curtains, small toys etc.  (This is no different that running a real vacuum)Bottom line - If you don't like house work or have pets which require you to vacuum every day this is definitely worth a try!"
9/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Agador Spartacus for the win,"We got the Roomba and promptly named him Agador Spartacus (the houseboy from the Birdcage). He gets the ever-present dog fur off the hardwoods and nails carpet. He doesn't mind stepping up on things (there's a bit of a step to get into the bathroom. He handles it well) and he lets me know when he's eaten a sock or something. I have a patterned carpet and there is a black spot that he cannot clean. He just stops and gives me an error message. The rest of the house looks great though, so five stars for Agador so far. If you have all black carpet, don't get a Roomba. But otherwise, it's totally worth every penny."
1/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,WE gave it as a gift and they LOVE it.
07/02/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Awesome machine,"We do not have any carpets in our home, just tile and wood floor and a dog that sheds a lot. This thing does a great job cleaning the dog hair on a daily basis while we are at work. I am extremely impressed."
08/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I highly recommend this product for anyone with kids and/or dogs,We bought this Roomba for our dark hardwood floors. We have two dogs that shed a lot and we were having to broom sweep almost every day. Now we just set a timer for the Roomba every other day and it takes care of dog hair and dust. I highly recommend this product for anyone with kids and/or dogs.
02/09/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba is the best!,We bought this Roomba 650 to replace an earlier model.  The expense to fix the older model would have been prohibitive so we replaced it.  We always have 2 operational roombas in our home.  This new Roomba does an excellent job.  Roomba just keeps getting better.
01/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It's perfect for picking up cat hair,"We bought the Roomba for my elderly Mother. It's perfect for picking up cat hair! She runs it during the night a few times a week and she can enjoy clean floors, both carpet mad wood, and now I don't have to worry about her dragging out her big vacuum. Love it!"
1/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,... a Christmas present and so far it has been great. Punch a button and leave it and it ...,"We bought the Roomba for a Christmas present and so far it has been great. Punch a button and leave it and it vacuums the room or rooms with no effort by you. All you have to do is dump the dirt container and periodiacally clean the brushes when its through. Takes about 2 minutes. If it lasts for a couple of years, it'll be well worth the cost."
5/31/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing!,"We bought the Roomba after reading many reviews on this site, we have it scheduled to run when we are sleeping and we wake up every morning to a clean downstairs!It vacuums in a random pattern, so if you watch it, it will probably drive you crazy where it might miss a spot or get stuck, but it runs for an hour and a half on our downstairs and I never wake up to a spot that was missed."
12/12/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Goodbye Vacuum!,"We bought the Roomba 650 about 3 months ago and have it scheduled to run every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday when we are at work. It is mind-blowing that the apartment can be clean all the time with just some minimal work to empty and clean the Roomba! The space is a 2 BR apartment with a combination of hardwood flooring and carpet. The only issue we have is the Roomba occasionally shuts the bathroom door while it is inside and can't get out. Once a week I move the kitchen chairs against the wall to give it room to get into the corner.We had one problem where there was an ""Error 10: Spin Roomba's wheels"" and the right wheel had seized up. After contacting iRobot customer service they quickly shipped a replacement at no cost to us, along with instructions (which were very simple). We are very satisfied and it's a huge time saver. I hope to never vacuum again."
12/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,The Right System for People on the Go,We bought the iRobot 655 a week ago in an attempt to keep ahead of the shedding hair from our two Astralian Sheppards.  We run the unit for approximately forty five minutes every other day; And it's thorough as it runs indepentently without any need to rescue it - Amazing!! Although it has yet to indure the test of time we highly recommend this system for hard working people on the go.
12/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Awesome !,We bought a third.  Enough said :)
10/20/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,So much better than the gen 1 version,"We bought a pad with mostly hardwood floors and decided to try the Roomba again. I bought the first gen Roomba which lasted about a year before burning itself up. I went through 3 of them (we had 2 cats at the time) before calling it quits. It just wasn't ready for prime time. This iteration is definitely not like the last. I am quite happy with it especially for the price point. It gets stuck under the couch more often than not but we are working on this via the invisible wall.This version picks up all of the hair (1 dog, 1 cat and a long haired wife) and when not napping under the couch it parks itself in the charger. Nice."
2/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,An excellent supplement to an upright vacuum cleaner,"We are very pleased with our Roomba 650. It works well on all of our floor surfaces: wood, tile, and rugs. It is able to clean underneath a lot of our furniture. As long as the furniture has a few inches of height clearance for the Roomba to go underneath, it will be able to clean those difficult to access areas. The Roomba does a great job supplementing vacuuming with a full-size vacuum. It will keep your house reasonably clean for a decent amount of time in between manual cleaning sessions, but it probably will not completely do away with the need to manually clean from time to time. It will however do a better job than a half-hearted manual vacuuming session. The Roomba 650 can easily be programmed to initiate cleaning cycle on specific days of the week at specific times.  We set ours to clean three times a week. The Roomba is very easy to open and empty the collector bin, and we do so about once a week. The Roomba is gentle when it runs up against furniture or walls.  After using our Roomba for several months, it has successfully docked itself to recharge its battery after every cleaning cycle.  All in all, we are very satisfied with our purchase."
5/20/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,iRobot does the trick,"We are retired and live in a 40 ft. motor home full time with a dog that sheds like crazy.  I was spending much time trying to stay ahead of the dog hair on the tile and rugs.  The iRobot, nicknamed Raul', works out great for our situation.  We spend much time hiking as we travel the U.S.  So it's easy to just turn Raul' on and walk out the door.  The cliff sensors keep him from falling down the stairs, and the combination rotating brush / vacuum does a great job on the throw rugs and tile.  I will say the first few times he swept, it seemed as if he wasn't picking up all the dog hair, but I realized the rugs had much more hair on them than I thought.  After he ""got on top of the excessive dog hair,""  this was not a problem.  Knowing how much my dog sheds, I can't say I'm surprised how full the sweeper bin is each time, but that's because the iRobot is doing a great job on the rugs as well as tile.  It is important to clean the bin, filter etc each time the iRobot sweeps, but that takes far less time than sweeping for sure!"
1/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"So far, so great","We are doing construction in the house and Roomba has been a good partner in helping us keep the place half decently clean. It does not pick the very fine dust that settles after wall demolitions, so one still has to mop the floors, but you can count on it to pick up everything else, especially if you give it the time to do it's unique pattern of space coverage. We've had it now for 18 days (received it 12/31/14) and used it almost every day for as long as its battery lasts."
09/04/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We love it and recommend buying one if you need it,"We are astonished at the ability of this little robut to clean around all of our furniture including our wood burning stove (during summer).  It learns the layout of the floor and sweeps up all the dust.  It leaves the wood floors shiny, the brick floor without crumbs, and the section rug smooth and clean.  It even cleans under the sofa and bed without getting all bunged up in wires.  What else could we ask for.  Don't answer that.  We love it and recommend buying one if you need it."
8/18/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Seems to do what we hoped it would do,"We are a couple with no pets, no children in our home, so we don't really have a lot of dirt.  We charged the Roomba as recommended overnight and used it the next day.  It ran for about an hour and then headed back to the dock.  It charged quickly and we used it again.  It did get stuck one time under the dishwasher, but in all other circumstances was able to free itself.  It does a good job and I was amazed at what it picked up.  I was a bit concerned that ""cleaning all of the yellow parts"" would make it less desireable, thinking that if I had to do that everytime I emptied the vacuum that it might not be worth it.  But, it was easy to do, so I'm not bothered by that anymore."
2/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Changed the way we keep our home clean - for the better.,"We absolutely love our Roomba! With two cats it can be a struggle to keep up with the fur they create on our hardwood floors. We find that it has some trouble with one of our rugs, but otherwise, it works as advertised. We clean out the compartment every 1-2 days, and it is full every time with hair, dust and dander. Once every couple weeks, we use the handy cleaning tool provided and flip it over and clean out the brush unit. It comes apart very easily and is a cinch to clean. I'd say it takes maybe 5 minutes to do this cleaning. If you don't do that more thorough cleaning the Roomba will start to get noisier - but keep it clean and there's no problems!"
1/31/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Way better then what I was expecting the best thing I ...,Way better then what I was expecting the best thing I have ever let live in my home!!! My african grey is not okay with it at this point but the cat loves it!!

5/22/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Surprisingly effective,Was slightly skeptical but was pretty tired of sweeping up after our 4 cats during the summer. Got this one because of the scheduling capability. Bought 4 virtual walls and this thing is saving me a bunch of time every day. Does a mix of hardwood and carpet. Got it at BB&B because of a 20% coupon.Thoughtfully designed and easy to disassemble and maintain. Would like to get a second and perhaps a scuba.Does not replace vacuuming once a week but would definitely recommend.
12/05/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,It isn't a Kirby or a dyson but it does a pretty good job,Was a little worried at first from the other reviews I had read. But I made the jump anyway. It isn't a Kirby or a dyson but it does a pretty good job. It goes from tile to wood to carpet and does a good job. The only down side is if you have a lot of human hair you have to clean it more frequently.  But I'm very pleased overall.
12/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Extremely pleased,"Very thoroughly picks up dirt, hair, dust, and little pieces of cat litter.  Keeps my floors clean and grit-free so that I can walk around barefoot without getting stuff stuck to the bottom of my feet.  I haven't quite figured out how it determines what pattern in which it will cover a room; it seems to move around at random, but I just let it go for a while and it eventually covers all the available floor space.  I live in a one bedroom one bathroom apt around 600-ish square feet, with tile in all rooms, except the bedroom which is (fake) hardwood.Now we just need a Roomba that mops!"

07/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love my Roomba!,"Very pleased with my Roomba!  I set it to clean every day when we are at work.  It does get caught some times under certain low furniture that I have to find it and put it back on the charger, but other than that I absolutely love it!!!  It is able to clean under areas I would never be able to reach with a regular vacuum like under beds, coffee tables, ect.  I wish I would have bought one much sooner!!!"

04/07/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Very entertaining to live with - and seems to  clean a lot more thoroughly than I ever expected.,"Very entertaining to live with one of these. The first time we ran it, it was like having a drunk person loose in our house. We turned it on and went into the family room. For the next hour or so, we heard it bumping into furniture and walls and chairs (gently, of course), we would see it come into the room we were in heading off in seemingly random directions, spinning around in circles at times, shooting off in a totally crazy direction after encountering an object, taking totally senseless paths around the room, leaving our room after just a couple of minutes, returning to our room for a couple of minutes, then leaving again prematurely, then returning, etc.. It roamed randomly around the several rooms it could access for the hour, then returned to its little dock and turned itself off. That hour of entertainment was worth the entire purchase price! I recommend you get one, invite a lot of people over, pour everyone a glass of wine, then turn it on for the first time. Your guests will have a blast watching the thing. But honestly, it got smarter and smarter each time we ran it. And it actually cleans a lot more thoroughly than I ever expected. We ran it after we had cleaned the rooms ourselves, and it came back to its little dock filled to the brim with dirt. So clearly, it was getting dirt we completely missed. I don't know how it will hold up over time, but from our initial experience over the first month, it has exceeded my expectations."
04/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It manages the climb up onto the rug easily and has not scratched the floor at all,"Very effective cleaning on both my hardwood floors and my area rugs.  It manages the climb up onto the rug easily and has not scratched the floor at all.  The programming is pretty simple to set it to work while you are out.  If you are home I feel it is a little noisy, however to be fair, my husband disagrees!"
03/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,Very easy to use.  Make sure to clean after each use.
03/03/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,If you have a rug be wary!,Very disappointed.  We recently installed hard wood floors through out our house so I was very excited to add iRobot as a family member.We had read all the reviews and had completed numerous comparisons~ we thought this would be perfect.When we purchased 2 area rugs we kept in mind that the rugs would need to be low cut so that the iRobot could get over them. We purchased a VERY low carpet just so the iRobot could work.Apparently our rugs are not low enough or iRobot does not have enough power.  Since we have purchased the vacuum it has not completed 1 cycle of a complete clean.  Every morning when I come down he is caught on the rug. Very frustrating.I would return this in a heartbeat except I checked our return date and the window closed yesterday:( I guess I will purchase grippers to apply to the wheels and hopefully this will help propel iRobot over my low lying rug.Our friends just recently purchased a robot vacuum and have carpet through out the entire house.  They love theirs~ it runs perfectly and is never stuck.  AHHHH

So now i am left to purchase a ac adapter to plug it in...so the scheduled cleaning is not a breeze as i expected:("
12/17/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Next best thing to hiring a maid,"Vacuum Area LayoutSq. ft.: 600Flooring: CarpetFurniture: Sectional, end table, ottoman, valet chair dining room table, cat tree, desk, office chairCats: 2Dog: 1Pros: Cleans areas thoroughly with spot clean feature Cleans hard to reach spaces (like under the bed) that are awkward to clean with a standard vac Roomba requires very little maintenance Huge convenience and time saver. Can be programmed to run anytimeCon: Gets very confused under the dinner and end tables Hard to confine to a space without electronic fences If interrupted during cleaning cycle will re-clean areas, get lost and shut off before finishing an areaPurchased Roomba 650 at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $320 with 20% coupon after owning a previous model for 3 years with no complaints.  So far, the Roomba 650 does an even better job of cleaning-up after us, our cats and puppy than its predecessor. The Roomba is fairly easy to program (ours is programmed 2 days/week) and covers the entirety of the house fairly well. Any spots that don't get perfect coverage in one cycle will get it in the next one or two. It's always surprising how much ""stuff"" is in the storage bin at the end of a cycle. It can get in a lot of spots (like under the bed) that are awkward to clean with a standard vac. The ""spot"" clean feature is also very handy. If something spills or if a high traffic area (like the front door) gets messy, just plop Roomba down and it will concentrate on that one 3 foot diameter area for 30 seconds or so.To quote another review, like our previous Roomba its not the maid from the Jetsons so dont expect it to run without maintenance or occasional surveillance. First, although Roomba requires very little maintenance you have to clean it. Cleaning the bin out after every run, and clean its brushes, wheels, and filter infrequently helps its performance. Second, the Roomba trains you to pick up after yourself and keep things off your floor. For starters, leaving shoes, wires, and other items in its path will not necessarily harm the device--but you may find it stuck at times. Also, the Roomba can pick up almost anything is its part (at least for a while) including leaves, paperclips, hair barrettes, animal fur and long hair. While this might seems impressive at first it will likely get full and not pick up much else afterwards on until emptied.All in all, I would buy again without a second thought. It's a huge convenience and time saver. My floors stay much cleaner than when I was manually vacuuming, and now I hardly have to do anything at all. With the hectic pace of life vacuuming is now one less chore we have to worry about."
07/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Such a great helper! Highly recommended,"Vaccume the floor completely and independently : know how to find its batty and how to escape from falling the stairs,Such a great helper ! Highly recommended."
11/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Its a paperweight,"Used to be a 5 star review! I loved this cleaner..until it stopped working for no reason. It won't charge ..it's a paperweight. I followed all troubleshooting steps..purchased a new battery..cleaned connectors etc etc etc. I contacted iRobot Customer service and they advised that I purchased battery that wasn't authentic (purchased from amazon.had 5 star reviews and is $50 cheaper than iRobot version) I tested the original battery and the replacement battery..both have over 10 volts yet neither will power on the cleaner. So I just shelled out $80 for the ""authentic"" battery with the hopes that iRobot Customer service will continue to assist. I have had the cleaner for 6 months. Purchased in May 2015. It worked great when it worked...now it's just a sad reminder of $600 spent and I'm sweeping my floors :/. If iRobot Customer service can't fix this then I'll have to keep this at a 1 star review. For reference...my roomba ran twice a week for 6 months. I have replaced filters and brushes twice in that time."

11/05/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba is a true and pure luxury that you DESERVE.,"UPDATE12/10/12:  WELL it just gets better and better... my house has never been so clean and with so little effort on my part... Since getting this roomba 2additional more friends ( total of 5 now)  have added a roomba to their homes. They tell me it is one of their best purchases.  THumbs UP for Roomba !______________________________________________________________________First let me say that having a Roomba is a true and pure luxury that you DESERVE.Well as a owner of a Roomba already and being quite pleased with it,  I was most anxious to try out the new 650 for pets.There are many tasks we are  charged with doing around the house that are , can I say boring and unpleasant, For me  vacuuming was one of them.. I dislike the loud sound  and the repetitive motion and that I never, ever seem to be DONE with that particular job..  As It seems I hardly finish and the lovely long haired cat seems to think that is the time to GROOM  and I am left with more hair where I just spent the last 1/2 hr cleaning... So when the Roomba arrived in my life ..All that changed.. It allows for  you to set a Schedule of regular clean up..  So you no longer have marathon sweeping sessions.. Roomba  does her job without directionBy the way a ROOMBA is a great entertainer for the CAT as well.. She is fascinated watching her move around the  house and keeps her totally entertained EACH time..She never gets tired of it.  I have a WHITE kitchen tile as well as bathroom tiles.. and any little crumb or drip of cereal SHOWS up like a Beacon. and I am not the tidiest cook in the world. But Roomba cleans up AFTER ME.. what a nice thing . I now come home to a CLEAN  nearly hair free and crumbfree floors... That I need do nothing to get that all done/ it is pure joy to KNOW that the mess isn't waiting for you.. My only JOB is to clean out the  small dustbin on the side of her and I do that every 2-3 days depending.. Takes less than 10 seconds.  And that is it.. and occasionally clean the brushes.  She cleans all the areas I NEVER get to .. like really close to the baseboards or UNDER the couch or beds... now my house is much cleaner than it ever was when only I was responsible for this cleaning chore..  then sweet Roomba entered my life.( sigh)  Let me say the ease of set up and instruction is wonderful...Take it out the box ( partially charged ) and turn on the button and away she goes... To get the max out of it is best to fully charge her before putting her through her paces. She comes with  some extras like the Virtual Wall ( helps control the flow of the cleaning for you) extra  filter and a charging base..I am going to get a 2nd litehouse for her.. As that allows me to better control the flow of her cleaningWhen I am home and she switches on,  a little TUNE is played to let you know she is OFF to do you daily chores... SWEET  SWEET SOUND.....After seeing my Roomba not one but two of my pet loving friends were OFF to purchase one ASAP.. And after they got them, their feelings were the same.. One told me she LOVES that all the little bits of litter her cats seems to attract is now gone from all her hardwood floors The other has a 2story house and dragging her old EXPENSIVE ball cleaner up and down to vacuum was getting old.. NOW she take Roomba up in the evening.. Turns her on and lets her go.. Later that night she brings her down stairs and puts her into her charging base and before she gets up in the morning Roomba CLEANS up the downstairs for her.. Now that is PURE LUXURY  and Pleasure to get  clean floors with so little effort.I can heartily recommend this Roomba if you want to make your life simpler and  happier.. ESP. If you share you home with one or more  4 legged friends..  This will put a smile on you face every time you hear Roomba sing her SONG>>"
11/05/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Huge improvement over previous roombas,"Update - two years later and my roomba 650 is still going strong - none of the problematic cleaning head modules or broken/clogged gears that my roomba 535 had.  I replaced it's Nimh battery with a li-ion battery sold here on amazon and it now can vacuum my entire downstairs on one charge - and that battery has been going on strong for over a year now with no issues - so I highly recommend replacing the battery with a li-ion one.I had a roomba 535 prior to this, and really got tired of pulling all the pet hair out (I have 3 dogs and a cat) - this new model is a huge improvement over that - I don't know how they did it, but they managed to pet hair proof it and somehow dog hair doesn't get stuck in the brush roll like it used to - it makes maintenance so much simpler with this one.  I also like how this one can go room to room and clean thoroughly without needing the lighthouse that older models needed.  And the onboard scheduling is a huge benefit on this, I have mine scheduled to run automatically downstairs in the middle of the night while we are sleeping upstairs, so every morning I wake up to a nice clean living room/kitchen.  The aerovac bin on this is nice, but I had already upgraded to that on my old 500 series roomba - so the single biggest improvement on this model really is the cleaning head module - it's just way more pet hair proof (and hopefully sealed better).I hope this is more durable than older models too but only time will tell. On my 500 series roomba I would have to replace the cleaning head modules, and edge brush assembly about every 6 mos. due to the plastic gears inside wearing out after accumulating too much pet hair inside the assembly - I haven't taken this one apart to find out if it still uses the same plastic gears or not - hopefully I won't ever have to.The only reason I won't give it 5 stars, even tho I love roombas and can't live without them and will probably always have one, is that they require a lot of repairs over time (new battery - $69, new side brush assembly - $30, new wheel - $30, new cleaning head module - $40, etc.)- with the first part to go being the battery - which is a definite downside on this newer models - they have decreased the battery warranty to 6mos and the old ones used to have a 1yr warranty on the battery. of course it was probably costing them a fortune replacing batteries, because generally I haven't had a single battery last more than 8 or 9 mos before diminishing run time significantly. And the batteries are expensive, I really wish they would make them with li-ion batteries that last longer and don't degrade over time.  Also, for the price these cost, the parts really should last longer - by the end of 2 years on my 500 series I had replaced almost every single part, some parts I replaced multiple times - plastic gears stripping out, wheels no longer spinning, etc. until eventually it seemed like the main sensor went out and it just flat out couldn't find it's way around anywhere.  The good side, is that they do sell the parts and everything is relatively simple to replace yourself so you don't have to pay for expensive repairs unless you want to.I hope these things are improved in this model, because $400 or more is a lot of money to pay for something that only lasts a few years. Even with the headaches of maintenance and the short life span, I would still buy them tho, because I hate to vacuum and I have a lot of pets, and they work wonderful for the first few years (again, I am hoping that this pet model will be better able to hold up to heavy use over time).  Also, for the reviewer that said his wasn't docking itself, mine couldn't find the dock for the first few days, but once it mapped everything out it now finds it's dock perfectly every single time, so maybe he just needed to give it time to learn the layout of the land.I forgot to say - this roomba does an excellent job cleaning 3 rooms every night with no input from me.  All rooms are thoroughly cleaned and I am amazed at how much dirt and pet hair is in the bin every morning when I go to empty it.  It's the next best thing to having non-shedding pets!"
8/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"The beauty of it is, you can actually do other things while it works for you...","Unless you can't stop watching it! Day 1 and it's basically the best thing ever.  I do wish the side brush was a bit longer to get into corners, but you can't be too picky, right?  At first, I was disappointed by its performance, it didn't seem to pick up EVERYTHING, and it goes in this random ""pattern"" but eventually it goes over the same areas multiple times picking up almost everything (including Play-doh!). It doesn't completely replace my Dyson (I still need the handle attachments for baseboards, corners and windows) but it works just the same as a once over except I don't have to do it!I ran it for the first time last night without doing any pre-sweeping or vacuuming and that's a lot of dust, fur and play-doh when you have a 13 lb. chihuaha, 90 lb boxer and messy toddler (who proudly announced that ""we should call it Greeeen Button!"" but later refers to it as ""the black thing"").8/25/15 Almost 2 weeks with Green Button and still loooooving it!  So much so that we will probably purchase a more expensive one with hepa filter for the in-laws for Christmas!"
11/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Not cheap both well worth it!,Two Labradors is double the hair! We recently replaced our carpet with hardwood floors and you could really see the dog hairs  everywhere. I guess with the carpet the hairs were not as noticeable. I usually turn the Roomba vacuum on as I am leaving the house and then the timer runs it again at noon. The little dirt catcher is full everyday. I love it! Before I got it I was sweeping and vacuuming everyday when I come home. The other day I vacuum with my Dyson to see what the vacuum wasn't catching and there was very little hairs and dirt when I emptied it.
6/26/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Mankind will never be the same again.,"Truly man has met his match both in intellect and skills. Has man become the second greatest being on Earth? Did god create man, only for man to create its superior? The turing test may have passed, but are we prepared for the consequences of what life is like among those who could easily destroy us? The roomba challenges all we know about robots."
3/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,One of the best purchases we've made,"True story:  For our anniversary last year, my husband asked what I wanted.  ""A small, handheld vacuum we can use to clean up under the kids' breakfast table,"" I replied.  (Not very romantic, but appliances win out over roses any day in this household.)  We got this instead, and I'm glad we did.Why do I love it?  Easy answer - with three kids under six and a 90-lb Doberman, our floors (carpet plus hardwood) take a beating.  Both parents work full time, and when we're home we'd rather spend time with the kids than vacuuming.  This allows us to do that.  This model does a fantastic job picking up the dirt and dog hair.  I've heard mixed reviews on earlier models, but this one works great in our house.Anything else?  YES.  My entire house gets vacuumed more frequently now that I'm not lugging around the vacuum.  Did I mention that it cleans under your furniture?  And that I can run it in my kids' rooms after they've fallen asleep?  (It's not loud, but not silent either. I wouldn't recommend running it while your kids are trying to fall asleep, because it probably would keep them awake.  But if they're pretty good sleepers, you can probably get away with running it at night.)Is it durable?  So far, yes.  We've had it 6 months and run it 2-3 times per day to get all of the different sections of the house.  I will note that the side brushes don't hold up as well - we've gone through 2 already.  I'm not sure that everyone will have the problem:  our iRobot cleans between some iron railings on our top floor, which can't be great for the side brushes.  But luckily, the replacement part is cheap.What should you know?  I absolutely love my iRobot, but will be the first to admit that it isn't perfect.  First, the charging station needs to be plugged in 24/7, so there is the electricity cost associated with that.  Next, the iRobot doesn't do as well as advertised with wires - it occasionally unplugs things.  The iRobot sometimes gets stuck, especially if you don't do a complete walkthrough to identify and pick up things that could get tangled in the brushes.  And finally, you need to clean the iRobot after every time you run the vacuum - empty the bin and clean the brushes.  More infrequently you'll need to clean front wheel, under the side brush, and filter.  The cleaning takes just a few minutes, but I recognize that some people would prefer a vacuum that you can just put away in the closet after you're done.  If you're one of those people, this probably isn't the vacuum for you.What can't I comment on?  I don't use the electronic room divider.Final thoughts:  I love this guy, so much so that my 3-year old started crying when I told her that the iRobot, ""Scoober,""  was my ""best kid.""  (I was mostly joking. :) )"
05/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Complete waste of money,"Tried to program this thing while I was at work due to it being fairly loud and intrusive while I'm home.  It constantly gets stuck somewhere.  Underneath the couch or it gets caught on the ledge going into the utility room.  Since the pattern it takes is seemingly random, I have no idea what areas it covered and what areas it didn't cover.  Complete waste of money.  I had high expectations based on reviews but it's just not working out for me.  Would not recommend."
01/06/2016,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Spend your money on something else.,"Totally dissatisfied. Sent it back. Not worth $365 Never worked without a problem. Thought it would be a time saver but with having to take it apart and reset it and calling customer service, no time was saved. Doesn't replace Getting out the vacuum or broom."
05/02/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,BEST!!!!,"Top ten purchases EVER made!!! Have 2 dogs, a single story house, neck injury and can't vacuum..ROOMBA to the rescue. I love this thing! My hardwood floors have never been cleaner. It really sucks up more grit and hair than my regular vacuum. PLUS I love that I can go do something leave the room and come back and it has not only cleaned it but gone back to its home to recharge.The design is brilliant. Cleaning/emptying it is easy and helped me see how much thought went into the design. Would totally recommend."

01/05/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Shh...don't tell the MIL your secret!,"Thrilled with the Roomba.  With 4 small kids, a dog, and both of us working full time and kids having sports, vacuuming is the last thing I have on my mind.  And it still is!  But the house looks so clean thanks to this little robot.  I am impressed with the results so far, we are one week into our Roomba's life with us.  It really picks up a lot of dirt and human/pet hair that we missed with our regular vacuum.  Cleaning out the dustbin and brushes is so easy.  While I don't expect this machine to be perfect... I am so happy to have it and even my skeptical hubby has been converted as well.  As long as it lasts (seems 5-6 years is life expectancy) for a long time I will be more than thrilled!Now when is the laundry folding robot coming out?  We will be first in line!!  Haha..."

3/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Thanks,This was the top of the line for us. Works like a charm. Picks up cat hairs and it is easy to clean.
1/16/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love It!,"This was the best ""Christmas"" gift ever!  It cleans great.  You just have to make sure that there are no items lying around on the floor if you want it to do a good job.  All I do is empty it every evening and it does all the work!"
02/07/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Best for open spaces,"This was really not appropriate for our home.  There is a lot of work involved in saving work.  After removing all the furniture and things on the floor, and worrying about the pets, so unable to leave it unattended, we sent it back.Best for open spaces, no kids or pets, minimalist furnishings."
4/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Rosie,"This was a splurge for me, but totally worth it. We love our 650, Rosie! I let it run every day. If I wasn't a dust-a-fobe before, I am now; this thing picks up everything so you can really see what settles on the daily. Its also really good motivation to keep clutter off the floor; I tell my kids to pick up or Rosie's going to eat their toys!We have 2 tiny humans and two cats, this thing is a life saver!! Only cons I've encountered are, it's too loud for the husband, but he's a poop, so don't mind him. And 2, it isn't as smart as I would like with accidental socks left on the floor or cords. Love that it can get under my cabinets; the dirt detect is awesome, and I've used spot clean, very cool design and programming!"
04/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great gift,This was a gift for my son who has a dog.  He told me it works amazingly well.  It is easy to program to vacuum everyday. Just about the best gift I have ever given him.
2/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Great, but NOISY!","This vacuum works well. It gets dirt far better than I thought it would!  It docks easily along a 2.5 foot space of bare wall (less than recommended) and cleaning it is even easier.  My only complaint is that it is noisy, so I don't like to run it everyday. The included virtual wall works great in front of our sliding glass doors.  Otherwise, the vacuum gets stuck in the door track. Works great on pet hair too (tho we have a doberman and he doesn't shed to terribly)."
09/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Had a very short useful life.,"This vacuum worked fine for a little over a year.  One day it was just dead - it would not turn on or charge.  It was used about 30-40 times and maintained very well.  At times it seemed like it took longer to keep the unit clean than it would take to vacuum with a regular vacuum cleaner but that is just the nature of the thing.After the unit stopped working and after trying all suggestions found on the internet, I contacted the company to see if they would stand behind their product.  They walked me through some troubleshooting steps (things that I had already tried) and concluded that I would have to replace the unit - at my cost.  There is no way I would waste another $300 + on another Roomba.  I am going to throw the thing away."

12/09/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Make the robots do the work!,This unit was shipped quickly as promised and is a replacement for on older unit that lost its sensors one to many times. They work great and are fun to watch but I think they should last longer than they do.
01/10/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,WOW SO MUCH CLEANER,This unit definitely exceeded my expectations. I got it for my wife for Christmas and she is a neat freak. She loves it. We both had no idea how dirty our floors and carpet were...this is an amazing cleaning device...so useful and easy to operate!!
02/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Just plain works.,"This thing's fantastic, one of the best purchases I've ever made for our home."
02/04/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,One of the best purchases ever,"This thing rules. It vacuums our house 4 days a week when we're not home. It's thorough. We have 2 puggles and 2 cats. The place is hard wood floors except for the kitchen and bathroom which are tile. We have a Flor area rug and a few throw rugs down. Our place is 2 bed, 1 bath, big living/dining area, and a kitchen. About 1100 sq ft. This gets everything. It takes a while which is why we love setting it for when we're not there. There have been 2 occasions where it got caught on a cord or something and didn't make it home to its base. But that's our fault for not prepping properly. Keep long, spindly stuff off the floor and this thing will do a great job. I hear the 700 series is the same price I paid for this one now. You should get it. You don't need the brand new version. The price to performance ratio isn't worth it. In my opinion."
10/16/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Holy Robot Vacuum, Batman!","This thing RULES!!!  I've been looking at these things off and on for about 5 years but couldn't convince myself it was worth the money.  We live way out in the country with 3 cats who are supposed to stay outside and prevent rodents, snakes and aliens from coming to visit, but the cats just walk away when I try to explain that to them. Oh sure, they'll bring me a mole or a gopher or a batch of baby bunnies to demonstrate their worth whenever they think I'm fed up, but mostly they con the kids into letting them inside and then sleep all day.  Never yet have they shown up at the door dragging an Ood or a Dalek along. Thank goodness for that, now I think about it. Anyway, the point of this rambling is that the cats think it's hilarious to manufacture vast quantities of fur and shed all of it while indoors. They also roll in cut grass, bushes full of prickers and the occasional dirt pile before darting inside and shaking it off. The floor seems impossible to keep clean for longer than 30 minutes.  So I did it. I shelled out $359 for this Roomba 650 and hoped it would grant me a few days between vacuuming without feeling like a horrid single father because my house was layered in stuff the cats literally dragged in.The Roomba arrived at 7pm yesterday. By 7:02 my teenage son had ignored the written directions entirely and set it up on its charging base with all the proper lights illuminated.  He pushed the 'clean' button and off it went, sucking up everything in its path!  Including an iPhone cord, my daughter's sock that for some reason wasn't on her foot, and a really disturbing amount of dust & fur. I mean, I'm not a slob and I clean regularly, for crying out loud!  Yeah, well, this stupid Roomba does a magnificent job. It cleaned along the baseboards beautifully. It spent a good 15 minutes purring around the beautiful motorcycles parked in my living room (told you I was single) and even went under the furniture. I'd worried it wouldn't suck hard enough to clean well or that the little dirt tray would fill up too fast - no such problems. It couldn't suck up the dimes it found under my night stand but it did fling them out into the light!It did a FANTASTIC job!!!The bad:Battery life is about 45 minutes. That's enough for my new robotic slave to clean the living room, kitchen, and make a foray into the laundry room. After that, he's off to his charging station for more juice.  That means the bedrooms and dining room don't get cleaned, so I'm ordering a second one to handle those.The software only allows you to program an automatic cleaning once per day.  It'd be nice if it would go back to work after taking a break, instead of acting like Congress and assuming that 90 minutes of work per day is enough.The dirt collection box is pretty small. We have 2900 sq ft of tile and wood floors and it'll fill its box in a single cleaning. That's just how it goes, though. The box is easy to dump and reinstall.The good:Sucks hard, picks up everything, and it even does a great job on baseboards!  It can't get into corners really, but must have good suction cuz it seems to clean the corners pretty well anyway.Despite the seemingly random pattern it covers the whole floor very effectively.I don't have to vacuum!!I love it. I'm getting another one to handle the bedrooms while this guy sticks with cleaning the common areas.Update 6 April, 15I did buy that second unit and am still completely happy.  I don't even have to bother vacuuming at all. Period.  I did learn that they will vacuum up cat diarrhea, unfortunately, but will then track that mess all over the house.  It took 6 hours - no joke - to disinfect the whole floor.  I was not having a good day that day.  Then disassembled the bots and suppressed the gag reflex to clean all the horrid stank from inside them.  I don't recommend this activity to anyone. Maybe to the ex, actually. But no one else.What I've learned in a year:  clean the buckets daily or at least every other day.  Brush off the filters or blow the dust out with compressed air (outside!) if you have access to such.  If you have a bigger house, the extended life battery packs more than double the cleaning time. I still get 45 - 60 minutes from the original battery but get 2 - 3 hours cleaning time from the higher capacity battery I bought."

3/31/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Could not be happier!,"This thing is just silly awesome.  The wife and I haven't vacuumed our dark wook floors since we got this as a gift almost 4 months ago.  We are clean freaks, and hate to see crumbs and scud on our dark, hand scraped laminate flooring.  Our ""great room"" is almost 1000 sq feet, and this Roomba does a great job in about 65 minutes of running.  We program it to run while we are at work, and come home to clean floors every night!  Who wouldn't like that!Before we were vacuuming every other day because the dark flooring shows so many crumbs and dirt.  We also pick it up and carry it to other rooms in our house where we have the same wood flooring to do its work while we do other things.  It is a sweet little piece of technology!The people who complain about the noise either need jobs to go to, or should put up with a tiny bit of inconvenience while it cleans your house for you... It is in no way more loud than either our upright vacuum, or hard-wood canister vacuum.  It cant do what it needs to do without making a little noise people, c'mon!If you have hard surfaces that show quite a bit of debris, I would 100% whole heartedly endorse this machine.  It is fantastic an one of the best gifts we have ever received!"
12/05/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,A great product for the handicapped!,"This thing is great. I ordered it as a present for my handicapped mother who has a hard time even dressing herself. I schedule it to clean on its own three times a week, and all she has to do is empty the bin!Does it take longer than a human would? Yes. Does it bump into everything while going 1/4 mph? Yes.It does a better job on hardwood than I do with a broom. It also does a decent job of picking up between cracks and at baseboards. Short and medium depth carpets are a cinch.Pros:+ Easy to use+ Schedule it to clean when you're away! (It's not that loud.)+ Finds its way back to the dock+ While it bumps into everything, it travels so slowly and has a good bumper that it does no damage+ Great vaccum+ Gets cracks and baseboardsCons: - Expensive - Bumps into everything and can push light boxes/shoes - Floor must already be free of ""large"" debris"

10/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba Rocks!,"This thing is AWESOME!  It is scheduled to clean every day while we are away during the week, and it keeps our hardwood floors clear of cat hair.  Just remember to periodically vacuum the furniture and clean out the Roomba, and you will have an overall cleaner house.  We got this model because it seemed to handle obstacles better, and we aren't disappointed.  I was fearful at first that it would fall down our wooden steps, but the sensors immediately know if it is about to go over the edge, and it has ninja-like reflexes that stop it and pivot it away from danger.  It also comes with an invisible wall that I use to confine the Roomba to only certain parts of the floor.  This is very practical and does work.  The invisible wall requires 2 C batteries though to operate.  The coolest thing about the Roomba is that it automatically goes back to its docking station when it finishes to recharge, which only takes an hour or so."
01/02/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Close to perfect,"This thing is amazing. The basic fact is that it cleans my 800 sq ft apartment by itself. I don't have to vacuum anymore. I hate vacuuming. The vacuum is always too short of my superior physical stature and causes back pain. It picks up everything, I'm so impressed with how well the device works. Now, to be fair, the unit has gotten stuck every time I have had it clean, but I feel like its not really its fault. It will get stuck on small objects or wires that you leave on the floor. Make sure everything under your bed and couch is clear, or, isn't small enough for the Roomba to get stuck going over.Its adorable, we want to name it. How ridiculous is that? One time he got stuck in the bathroom because he shut the door while he was cleaning in there and I actually felt bad for him. As long as you baby sit this unit, or, you don't have a somewhat cluttered NY apartment, this thing runs great.I can't seem to figure out its logic, as it sort of seems random, and it does spend time running over the same places over and over until its done, and it can even appear seriously confused. Its also very loud, so I wouldn't recommend running it if you want to watch television or something.Some tips:Clean out the filter every time you run it (easy as tapping on open garbage can a couple of times)Clean out the brushes every three timesBest babysit it a few times to make sure its not getting stuck on thingsMake sure the base unit doesn't slide on the floor as the robot tries to dock with it"
5/17/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Picked up enough pug hair for me to build ANOTHER PUG!,"This thing is amazing. I watched it do the first cleaning and it's so smart and thorough. It went over dirty corners at least 4-5x and picked up an insane amount of dirt and dog hair. The best part was I had just swept the floor - clearly not as good as a robot can do. We'll see how the long-term maintanence goes, but for now, I'm in love."
05/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Just buy it.,"This thing is amazing. Aside from emptying the back collection tray and occasionally cleaning the brushed underneath of long hair (especially women's hair longer than 12""), there is no maintenance.  I have a dog that sheds (especially in the springtime) and i always had dog hair everywhere in my house - that is no longer a problem at all. Pretty amazing product for the cost. It is only $7.70 per week to keep your floor virtually spotless. Great deal."

We have hardwood floors throughout the house, and my wife and daughter would spend hours each weekend sweeping and keeping dust-bunnies at bay.  I bought this Roomba on a lark, thinking I would try it, but not expecting much.  We all walk barefoot in the house now -- the floors are dirt and dust free.  I programmed it to run once-a-day, in the middle of the day when we're not home.  What's equally amazing is how much dust it picks up each and every day.  Worth every penny!"

It's downright eerie to see it figure its way around a complex room.  It seems to have an insect-like intelligence.It's a bit noisy so you'll know when it's running, but it's not as noisy as a regular vacuum.  And it picks up an obscene amount of dirt and hair, from both carpet and bare floors.  Our pets were mildly concerned at first, but now they just amble out of its way when it comes towards them.Now I wish I had bought one years ago."
4/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Replaced Wife - this thing rocks!,This thing is amazing.  Cleans for 1 hour on my schedule.  Makes it's way around my dining room table and chairs like a pro.  Collects two handfuls of dirt/dust every three days.  Easy to clean and maintain.  Well worth the money.
01/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This thing is amazing!!,"This thing is amazing!!!!  Would buy another one in a minute!  We have 2 Cocker Spaniels inside, and we usually run it 1 time a day or every other day.  It blows my mind what it picks up simply because the floors look clean before we start it.  When its done however its almost always full."
12/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Awesome,"This thing is amazing!  I can sit in my recliner reading my kindle while it scurries around cleaning my house.  With 5 dogs, it's amazing how much dirt is in the bin every day. It seems to learn as it goes.  The first few days, it would clean for an hour, then dock and charge it's battery for a couple hours and then go back at it for another hour.  Now it only does the first hour.  The floor is spotless!"
06/01/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it!,"This thing is amazing!  Every day I empty the tray and there is more dirt even though I didn't even know I needed to vacuum.  So easy, too!"
12/19/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,No more dust bunnies under the bed.,"This thing is a real trooper.  It manages to find its way under and behind furniture that I would never expect it to navigate.  The amount of dust and dog hair it picks up is amazing.  It is a little louder than I expected and crashes into things more than I thought it would, but overall it does a great job."
05/11/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Piece of garbage,"This thing broke after about a month of use, definitely do not purchase it.  This has no durability, certainly not worth the price."
09/06/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,waste of money and electricity,"This stupid device is just that - incredibly stupid. I don't know what sort of logic the roomba uses to calculate that it has done its job, but it is clearly flawed. In the *rare* occasions that the roomba has ever completed its cycles, I always see leftover instances of dirt, hair, dust, etc in random spots. Moreover: - If you don't have furniture with long legs (at least 6 inches of clearance) or very low furniture (i.e. no more than 2 inches of clearance), do NOT waste your money or time. This device loves to get trapped under furniture and will never finish cleaning the room. - If the room has any floor mats or rugs, the roomba will get stuck and never finish cleaning the room. - If the base of your floor lamp or fan is less than 3 inches high, the roomba will likely get stuck trying to go over it and never finish cleaning the room. - If you do not have your charging base and its related power adapter secured properly (i.e. making it roomba-proof), the roomba is likely going to die wandering around the room. It will not be able to find the dock that it stupidly relocated (and possibly disconnected from power source) and will never be able to recharge. - If you don't replace your batteries for the virtual walls frequently (at least monthly), the roomba will wander off to where it shouldn't and die.Save your money and just get a reliable broom. You will *easily* clean the room faster & better than *any* roomba. It will cost you far less money and use far less electricity, and make far less noise. AND you will get some exercise."
11/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,This roomba is the best!!!
12/30/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roombas are AWESOME,"This Roomba is great! I have two dogs, and it's tough to keep up on vacuuming.  This unit allows me to schedule it to clean while I sleep, so when I wake up, all I have to do is clean out the tray.  I have it scheduled to vacuum 3 nights a week, and it finds quite a bit of dust and hair!On a side note, I had an allergy test done that said my biggest allergy is to dust. Any time my Roomba cleans, the next morning, my house feels so much cleaner, and my allergies feel so much better."
12/08/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,WOW what a difference !,"This Roomba is exactly what I needed.  I have #3 pets that shed terribly and was vacuuming almost everyday to keep up with all the shedding.  I now schedule the Roomba to run 7 days a week and it is amazing how much hair this thing picks up.I don't have to vacuum nearly as much and my wooden floors / carpet look great all the time.  As others have written, you do have to  declutter the  floors so it won't get stuck.You do have to empty and clean after each use which takes a couple of minutes.  Not a problem.Is it worth the money?  Well I wish it was cheaper so I could buy a couple more,  however it has saved me time, which is worth a lot."
9/27/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Big improvement over early Roomba models! Keeps the dog hair in check.,"This Roomba is changing our life. We had a 1st-gen Roomba years ago, but this is a vast improvement. It hasn't gotten stuck, has found the dock every time, and, most importantly, it seems to be heavier than the old models, which gives it much better traction when climbing onto area rugs, etc. Still need to touch up our area rugs weekly, but this is conquering all of the dog hair on our wood floors and our wall-to-wall carpeted bedroom. Haven't set up the scheduling feature, yet, so I can't comment on that. Right now we're alternating days between our living room/hall/kitchen and our bedroom (1000 sf apt.)not because it couldn't necessarily clean both in one shot, but because our dog is terrified of it, and we need to give her a refuge from it so she doesn't have a heart attack."
10/26/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Picks up dog hair!,"This Roomba has saved my sanity.  Cleans up doghair!  You definitely have to empty it daily, and it will not replace a ""real"" vacuum cleaner - but I no longer have dust bunnies."
04/06/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great for cat hair,"This Roomba has saved me so much time. It gets most of the cat hair from my four cats. I have dark hardwood floors, and the white cat hairs really show up. I love sitting around while it does the work, or coming home to a fresh floor if I left it set to run automatically. The dust bin is easy to dump. I do find it works better if I confine it to part of the house, and run again in a different section. The entire house is about 2300 sq ft. I can easily divide it into 3 different areas, and run the Roomba in one section at a time. I have tile and carpet and bathroom rugs as well as hardwood, and it handles all those surfaces just fine."
03/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Just about Flawless.,"This Roomba eliminates the annoyances I had with my previous 500 series model.  First, the brushes are a lot easier to clean and maintain.  Second, unlike my old Roomba, it doesn't pick up dust bunnies only to scrape them off along the edges of my rugs.  Third, it seems to cover more area in one session as it runs about an hour and a half before docking itself.I have an 1160 square ft. loft space with polished concrete floors and three large low-pile rugs.  I schedule Roomba to run M, W, F, at 11 pm. After the first night, I mostly sleep through the humming sound and actually if I awaken and hear it, rather than annoy, I feel soothed, knowing 'a little robot elf' is sprucing up the joint while I sleep.  My only complaint at this point is that it doesn't do windows...I keep a virtual wall near the cat's water bowl, mindful that water and Roomba are not friends.  For my space Roomba is perfect.  I haven't vacuumed in months and my crib is spotless."
12/17/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,great time saver,"This roomba does vacuum for approximately two hours and has only gotten hung up once.  It got in a corner and couldnt get out.  It really does pick up the dust.  I'm not sure I like the change in the filter set up or the cost of filters but I believe they are the hepa filters.  Much more expensive, but I am impressed with its results.  It does a good job."
9/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Roomba 650,This Roomba does a great job getting up the pet hair!
1/24/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Robot for a Busy Neatfreak,This robot keeps my place clear of cat hair. I have it programmed to run 4X a week while I am at work. Means I get to spend more time enjoying my weekends and less time cleaning.
2/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,This Robot is amazing. I love it. This became my personal assistant.
8/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Amazingly Useful,"This robot didn't disappoint me and my girlfriend at all. Even my mother bought one for her and my grandma after I showed it to them. It will clean the superficial dirt very well, what includes hair and light dust. However, it is not a permanent replacement for the vacuum because it won't pick the heavier, thin dust that sits in the bottom surface of the carpet. My only complaint is that it will avoid some dark colored spots in the carpet thinking that there is a cliff. I did try covering the cliff sensors, but then it won't work. In the video for this review you can see how it keeps backing up when encounters darker patterns on my center rug. If your carpet or floor happens to have high contrast patterns I'd recommend you to test Roomba there as soon as you get it to make sure that it will work for you. This old issue is briefly mentioned in the User Manual."
11/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,"Although the vacuuming is very good, I'm very disappointed that I now have to ...","This product should be recalled, as the black body of the Roomba 650 leaves marks on white trim as it navigates the room, dragging and bumping against the walls and/or trim pieces.  I complained to iRobot, which sent me white strips of plastic as a sort of bumper to mitigate this risk.  The trim pieces fell off after a week.  Although the vacuuming is very good, I'm very disappointed that I now have to repaint all my trim pieces in 4 rooms, an expensive proposition.  I cannot recommend this product, especially if you have wall trim painted in white, because it will do significant damage to your paint.  The black marks left by the Roomba do NOT clean off, either."
12/19/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Better technology than before,This product replaced a 1st generation Roomba. Love this thing! Will buy another for the second floor of my home.
06/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,excellent,This product really works. Gets the floors very clean
12/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Just terrible. Hire a cheap maid instead.,"This product needs to be completely redesigned and re engineered from the ground up. In this age of wifi there is no reason for this product to rely on impact and line of sight to operate.If you have an empty 10x10 room and 30 minutes to clean (or 5 minutes with a regular vacuum) then this is for you.  If you live in a house that actually has a floor plan layout, you're SOL. Yes, it does pick up dirt, but so does my sock. It randomly bounces around and become completely transfixed by certain areas in the room. The area under our table and chairs is immaculate, for example.It does NOT learn your floor plan. It does NOT remember where it has been. It doesn't NOT remember the dock location.This might have been cool 10 years ago but with smart devices and the Internet of things prevalent in today's appliances this thing is simply too primitive.And WAY TOO LOUD!Buy a cheap bare floor vac for $50 and spend a little time cleaning."
07/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This has made my life easier,this product makes my life easier. my dog sheds like crazy and this has cut down my vacuuming and makes my wife happy! happy wife happy life. worth the money and will get another one if this one every dies but we have had it for 9 months and its still going strong. I put some bumper pads on mine so it doesn't ding my wood furniture just a word of advice.
12/24/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,If it only did the dishes...,"This product is fantastic -- a giant leap into the future.  It does the job, then recharges itself -- love, love, love it."
04/07/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Works so well!  Perfect to keep pet hair in check.,"This product is awesome!  It works great.  We have two cats and lots of hardwood.  It really gets the job done.  What surprised me was how well it does on carpet.  It also has no problem navigating some of the rough transitions, room to room in the house.  I only wish we had gotten it sooner."
1/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,LOVE it keeps my house cleaner and helps tremendously with allergies!,"This product is amazing! I was very in between about getting one, but after having it, I will always own one.We live in the country where it is constantly dusty and there is always sand and dirt getting brought in. I was constantly sweeping and vacuuming trying to keep the floor clean and it was driving me crazy. After using this the very first time, I was so shocked at how much it had picked up. When I first ran it, I thought my floors were pretty clean, but after it was done cleaning, the bin was full of dust and dirt that my broom and vacuum weren't picking up. I was amazed. This has helped tremendously with my allergies by all the dust it picks up, that I was unable to get.I have hardwood floors as well as carpet and rugs down and it transitions over all of those perfectly and still cleans the same on all surfaces.It is great at detecting things on the floor, like children toys, furniture, phone cords, etc. and avoids them or if it happens to pick something up, it knows to spit it back out. I have had it pick up a few small toys and a phone cord and none were damaged, I was able to release them easily and in perfect condition.My floors are way cleaner now then they ever were before.Easy to use and has features where you can schedule your cleaning for whenever you want.I LOVE this product and don't have any complaints."
9/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,LOVE IT,"This may be the best thing I have ever purchased. I have no idea what the negative reviews are about. Our house is an open concept and we turn it it on and let it run. I sometimes put carpet powder down and when it's done, all the powder is gone so I know it's working. My house is about 3500 square feet and I have to run it on 3 separate charges to clean the whole house so I am thinking about getting another. It always comes back with a full bin, which is great but gross at the same time. LOVE IT"
7/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Works perfect!!!,This makes two that I own.The first one I have had for about 4 years and still works great.This one seems to be just as good with a few extras.
6/29/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing machine!,"This machine is amazing ... I have run it once a day for a week and my home feels so clean. Our two dogs shed PROFUSELY and keeping up with the dog hair has been a challenge, sweeping and vacuuming every day. Not only are my hardwood floors, tile floors and carpet clean as a whistle, the dust level in the house has been dramatically reduced. The surfaces under my bed and furniture are spotless. This little guy is very quiet .... just does its thing and goes back to its docking station when done. I can't say enough about it."
2/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Works as advertised and my wife's favorite gift ever.,This little sucker works - pulls in pet hair and dust without a problem.  I does need to be cleaned after each use as the filter box is not that big.  Great having an auto-vacuum to keep floors and carpets free of dust and pet hair.
01/02/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"I feel so lazy, but I don't care!","This little robot might make me officially lazy, but it also makes my carpet so much cleaner on a consistent basis. I now ""vacuum"" daily, rather than weekly (after much procrastination, grumping, and general dragging of feet). It is so easy. You dump the rubbish bin out of the butt end of the robot, make sure the rollers aren't covered in hair, and hit a button. Maintenance is simple enough -- clean out any snags on the removeable rollers and check the wheels for hair wads. No prob.I thought the Roomba might be a novelty that I get sick of, but this thing really, really works. I have two cats and a partner with long hair, so fur tends to accumulate quickly around here. This little robot is a lifesaver. The fur gets swept up without much effort from me, and the cats get a little workout chasing (or feeling chased, depending on which cat we're talking about) roomba around the house.Highly recommended. Pet owners, get one of the pet models like this one."
12/13/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,this little robot is amazing especially with our yellow lab.  cleans corners base board ect. its incredible!
01/04/2016,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"We Love ""Hazel""","This little robot has made life much easier. My shiny kitchen floor was a magnet for dust and debris. In the morning I would swear there were little gremlins that came out each night and partied. ""Hazel"" takes care of all that for me now. She goes to work about five every morning and when I come downstairs at seven she has everything looking perfect. I set her to work under the bed a couple times a week and for the first time in a long time I have no dust bunnies under there. Like the real Hazel on the TV series she's not without her opinions. Apparently one day she thought I wasn't doing a good job in the living and dining rooms and she pushed aside the virtual wall and cleaned those as well. I have to admit that they did look great. She's also not a quiet, meek little thing. She makes her presence known by banging around some mornings and has an ongoing disagreement with the kitchen floor registers; she thinks they should be closed. She has gotten herself into a jam a couple times by getting stuck under the china cabinet or couch but is too proud to call for help. I just find her quietly waiting for me to free her.  Overall, she's a great addition to the family; I just wonder how long it will be before she asks for a raise."
2/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This little machine is the real deal. I have ...,"This little machine is the real deal. I have hard wood floors, a German Shepard, and a cat.  The animal hair dust balls drifting around the house are a thing of the past. I even have a small door frame ledge that Thomas (which is what I named him) intrepidly climbs over to get to the computer room.  I'm starting cat Roomba riding training later this week, will report back on results. I sweep religiously, but Thomas is much more serious about dust management, as the picture below indicates (one Roomba sweeping cycle):"
12/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Very easy for initial setup,"This little guy gets the job done. Very easy for initial setup. I have a scheduled run at midnight every night and typically run him once during the day. His tray always fills up, even though I vacuum on my own (with a dyson). He has always found his way back to the dock, which was one thing I was worried about based on reading reviews before hand and my placement of the dock (beneath an end table in the living room, only one way in and out) The cleaning method the Roomba takes seems to be sporadic at best, but can't argue with the results."
05/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This little gem is amazing. I could not believe how much dirt and ...,This little gem is amazing. I could not believe how much dirt and dust it picks up. I love it!
04/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Must have for excessively shedding pet owners.,"This little gadget is worth its weight in gold.  I run it just about every time it has a full charge.  I have two dogs that seemingly shed their body weight on a daily basis and this little vacuum somehow manages to keep up.  I have noticed a HUGE difference in dust in the house and hair on the carpet since I've owned this.I run it on both tile and carpet without issue.  It does a pretty good job of returning home to charge, although it occasionally gets stuck under one of my end tables. I tear it down and clean the brushes and sensors once a week.  It comes with an extra filter, I during my weekly cleaning I pull the filter out and gently clean it with some warm water and run the Roomba with the other filter while the first one is drying.  I'm considering buying another one two be able to vacuum both floors at the same time."
07/01/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"If you don't own one of these, you're wasting your time!","This is without a doubt one of the greatest purchases I've ever made.  I'm self-employed and tend to work very long hours which lends little time to small tasks around the house.  I simply schedule my Roomba for 2:00pm everyday and he does the rest.  Does great with pet hair, dust, dog food, and just about everything else!  I don't have to do that weird thing anymore where the bottom of one foot brushes of the top of the other after walking on my hardwood floors...  The only down side to this that I wish I would have known is the Roomba will only clean 1 room at a time, but if you just set him up and let him do his thing, you can come back to him in 30 min or so and the room is clean!  You can then just move him to another room and let him do the dirty work.  EVERYONE SHOULD OWN ONE OF THESE!"
06/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Undoubtedly the best household purchase I've ever made,"This is undoubtedly the best household purchase I've ever made.  I have a long-haired chihuahua and a pug, both of whom shed fine white hair copiously.  I was vacuuming the house several times a week to keep on top of the dog hair and dust balls.  Though I still find I have to run the Roomba a couple times a week to stay on top of the problem, at least my time is not caught up in the endless task of vacuuming!  An added plus of Roomba's industry is that I find that hearing my little iRobot at work serves as a motivating force for me to join in on the cleaning effort, say, by polishing the furniture!  The amount of hair and dust iRobot picks up each time is just astounding, and makes me the more appreciative of having this new feature in my life.  I can only imagine that my previous vacuum was only scratching the surface of the detritus that needed to be removed. I feel confident that iRobot is slowly, but surely making measurable improvement in my surroundings - including my air quality!  If there was ever a counterpart to the movie, Her, where the protagonist falls in love with his operating system, this could be it - a housewife falling in love with the obedient, helpful, silent butler of a robotic vacuum cleaner!"
6/21/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Great product, Just leave it on and let it do its trick !","This is truly a great product. We were going to get the Dyson and one of our friends told us to buy the Roomba. At first we were skeptical but went ahead with it. WOW. Thank god we didn't get the dyson and bought the Roomba instead. Makes life so much easier. This thing picks up dirt that you can't imagine. It's easy, simple, and a really high quality product. It knows where to go, has sensor technology to slowly approach walls so don't worry about any scratches, chips or dents. It maps out your entire home area and keeps cleaning. No more lower-back pain whenever you vacuum your house ! You can clean your house everyday if you like while focusing on other things, just switch it on and it will clean for hours. Highly recommended. Get it, don't over think it."
04/03/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Third Roomba we've owned- much improved,"This is the third Roomba we've owned since the original came out years ago.  Those were nice, but the improvements to the brushes and dirt chamber make this one a real winner.  The vacuuming power is much improved.  We spend less time cleaning it, and it does a much better job at cleaning!  We are so glad we got this one.  We just hope it lasts a little longer than our first two, which experienced logic board failures and the like after just a couple of years."
9/23/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great invention!,"This is the second one I have had! It is great to set and go. I have mine set to run each morning after I have left for work and get home to a clean floor. I have birds and they  are forever dumping food on the floor, with this I  do not have to sweep it multiple times daily"

If I knew how much help this would be for our family I would have bought it earlier.And It does work, I am surprised how much dust is present in the apartment.

Two of my Sons bought them and after seeing how they worked I wanted one and am so far very happy with it. The 650 cleans better than what I ever expected, I have 2 cats and it picks up the cat fur extremely well. My carpets are pretty old and worn out but the 650 has made them look a lot better. The 650 also picks up pretty much everything off my kitchen floor and has made housework a lot easier. The battery life is very good, so far no complaints. A couple of important points if you are considering one, make sure you empty the waste container after each use...it does fill up pretty fast. Follow the maintenance instructions and this will work fine. If you don't clean the brushes regularly, especially if you have cat hair or dog fur then it will not function well. This is a terrific product and am very happy with it!"

This machine is such a time saver and is a little tank!  Keeping the floors clean reduces the dust on everything else.  We've programmed it to run every morning.  The kids carry it upstairs - it's so lightweight.  It knows to stop at the stairs and we didn't purchase any virtual baby gate for it.  I am saving to get one for my 95 year old Grandma.  She is going to love it and I'm so happy to get her something to help ease her worry of being unable to have her house cleaned as she would prefer.  So long stinky perfumes, scarves and sweaters - she's about to have a new pet (as our kids would say)."

3/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Best purchase ever,"This is the best thing I have ever bought in my life, and I am almost 50. Mittens inspires everyone to keep the house picked up, which is amazing. I was just about to hire a maid to come clean my apartment each week, but I thought I'd try this first. I just can't believe how clean my whole place stays.  It takes about one second a day to empty the dirt thing. Literally in the time it took me to get my big vacuum out of the closet and plugged in, I could do a whole weeks' worth of maintenance.  It was really easy to program, like a monkey could do it. Just hold the button down. I LOVE coming home to clean floors. It's just such a relief to not have to vacuum all the time.  My son watched it work one day and said it didn't seem very efficient. Who cares? When he was little I used to let him ""help"" me clean the house by running the vacuum. I figured, whatever he accomplished was more than I would have accomplished by not vacuuming that day.  Same with this thing. So it doesn't get every square inch every day. It will get done.  I've had it for about 2 months and I know I will always have one. I've wanted one since they came out and I'm so happy with this purchase!"
1/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Your life will be forever changed.,"This is the best thing ever created, and this is the cheapest version! I have heard of Roomba's for years and have always wanted to get one but didnt want to pay for it. When he arrived he was bigger than I thought he would be, pleasant surprise. We ended up naming him Trevor. You cant just call it ""The Roomba"". Despite the angelic female voice that comes out of him when he gets a cord in his mouth, he is very manly and fits into our 3 male cat household splendidly.So yes, he does pick up cords sometimes so that is a downfall. I have a skinny ipad cord he ran around with for a bit but when I took it from him it was unharmed--- If you have pets I guarantee they have caused more damage to your prized possessions than little Trevor could ever do.Pros:-Our cats are terrified of the real vacuum and act like a tragic death is imminent. Trevor is noisy but they just move out of the way in a annoyed way.-Can be programmed to run anytime you desire- 2am is our set time.-Can press clean and do an extra run anytime-Trevor returns to base to charge himself when he is getting low battery.-Gives you a full weekend of excitement when you first get him, i cancelled all my plans and just bonded with Trevor.-Returning home after a long day at work to a clean house has never been so good, unless you have a stay at home wife that cooks.-Is able to get the corners and that disgusting space in the kitchen between the linoleum and baseboards where food particles like to rot.-Wont fall down stairs- I stood at the edge of the stairs watching him, sweating and heart pounding because he races to the edge but then slams to a stop just in time. No need to be a helicopter parent with this guy!-He goes under beds and couches, if you have seen Arrested Development the tv show, you will know what I am thinking/laughing about.-A friend actually said our carpet looks a different color. How embarrassing but just provides evidence of the cleaning power of Trevor the Roomba.Cons:None of the cons are a reason not to get one.-Pick up cords or push against the wall out of the way.-Empty filter (halfway through cycle if you have a lot of pets)-Due to his cleaning noise, turn the tv/radio up and annoy your neighbors-May interrupt your cats precious 22 hour nap time.-Your dog may bark at it but that just means you need do a little more training."
2/19/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Best investment,This is the BEST investment I ever made.  Easy to use and easy to clean.Area rugs? no problem. Good customer service. 100% satisfied.  Strongly recommend to anyonewho is tired of vacuum floor everyday.
08/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I dont have to vaccum!,"This is the best invention ever!We have 1 cat, 1 dog, and 2 bunnies. We have a 3 story house. I rotate this roomba a couple times a week to each level. It will clean 1 level perfect on 1 charge, approximately 1,000 sq ft."
12/11/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,In short - I LOVE THIS THING,"This is the best gift I have ever bought for myself. If I were wealthy, I would buy one for everyone I love! THANK YOU to amazon.com for encouraging the peer review process and my fellow consumers for sharing your experiences. I read dozens, perhaps even hundreds of reviews before I bought this. It just seems too good to be true! I read the 5 star reviews, the 1 star reviews, and the detailed, 3-star reviews because that is where you really get to the heart of the pros and cons. I compared every brand of robot vacuum and once I decided Roomba was for me, I compared all of the different models and read multiple reviews on each of the features. Therefore, I had very realistic expectations and I am happy to say our little Roo has surpassed all of them!Many people said you have to babysit it the first couple of times it runs to see what it will get caught up on, and this is absolutely true, but is not a burden because its process is fascinating. We've had it for a month now, set to automatically run before we get up each morning, so I clean the brushes before I go to bed each night. Rooms that would normally not be vacuumed more than a couple of times a year (teenagers' bedrooms) are being vacuumed weekly now! The original color of the carpeting is beginning to show again!One very cool thing it does is when it gets to an edge, like the top of the stairs, the cliff sensors tell it to stop. Then it will gently approach the edge, all along it, to get a sense of how big it is. Then it will repeatedly fling itself at the edge with a ""running start"" and stop at the last second so abruptly that the back end lifts off the floor so it cleans all the way to the very edge of the ""cliff"". Such commitment! :D"
09/08/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Note - the device is designed to be cleaned easily and cleaning it needs frequently,This is the answer to my prayers!  I have two dogs - one being a husky - and I have had to deal with excessive dog hair.No more - this Roomba takes care of it for me.  Note - the device is designed to be cleaned easily and cleaning it needs frequently!  Not a problem to me and sure beats the alternative - I love this product!
12/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Waste of Money,This is supposed to clean dog hair and clean your entire room.  This vacuum goes back and forth over the same spots and never picks up the dog hair just spreads it evenly over the carpet.  It gets stuck under our couch and on the change from carpet to wood floors.  Every time I start it it is a game to see where it got stuck and stopped working.  I wish I could return it.  Total waste of our money.
3/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba is my girlfriend.,"This is such a lifesaver! We have a dog business and there is always mounds of dog hair around the house. Roomba takes care of all of it! We empty the filter after every use just so we don't overwork it, but no complaints here!"
02/05/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great Product!!!,"This is really a good product. We have 2 cats and 1 dog and they all shed a lot. We have dark hardwoods, dark carpet, and light tile. I was a little leery ordering the Roomba, because I wasn't sure that it would clean with the thoroughness that I desired, but I have to admit that it met my standards. I was concerned with it's random patterns at first, but I realized after a while that even though the cleaning patterns aren't that efficient, it does them so long that it eventually cleans everything.On carpet, it doesn't appear to have the suction power that our standard vacuum has, but it gets under beds and furniture which is a plus. Also, it vacuums from so many different angles and for longer than I would spend vacuuming, so in the end, the floors wind up just as clean as a standard vacuum.On hard surfaces (hardwood, tile, etc.), it does excellent. It seems to be set up just right for these types of surfaces. NOTE: We don't have grooves in our hardwood. I'm not sure how well it would do getting dust out of grooves, but it does do well on our tile and tile grout.Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase. If you have animals, I would highly recommend this product. The price is a little high, but as long as I get several years (4 or more) out of it, I would definitely buy this product again."
6/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Two years of service,"This is quite possibly the best appliance for which I have plunked down my credit card.  A housekeeper I am not - and there is no way I would have the spare cash to pay a nice lady to come in every week to run my Hoover about sucking up the mounds of pet hair that my over-appreciated Great Dane shakes off in clouds. After I moved into my new home in the USA, I got an estimate: $80 per four hour day plus car fare. Now admittedly, that included cleaning the baths and the kitchen, and dusting. But not the windows or the laundry, changing linens or beds. I admit to being spoiled - I had a weekly housecleaner in my former home one day a week for $250 a month - she did everything, including all the washing, ironing, etc.After hovering the place a couple of times myself, I knew that this was not my calling - and so, bought this little gem on a lark - who knows, it might just be worth a try.Now, almost two years later, I am totally hooked. The Roomba has done its fascinating blunder every morning at 6 am while I shower and dress, walk the dog and make coffee. It occasionally gets stuck on a piece of clothing tossed carelessly on the floor, or a lamp wire trailing on the floor, or one of the dog blankets. and sometimes can't find its way back to the charging station - the house is big, about 2500 sq ft of hardwood everywhere but the bedrooms, and I leave the guest bedroom doors open. Biggest trap is the dining chairs - it sometimes moves chairs about in such a way that it can't find a way out of the forest - but I know where to look when it isn't on the recharging station.I installed a ""soft pad"" on the bumper, just a 1/4"" rubber tube that juts out and compresses on impact with chair legs to cushion the blow. I did this after the Roomba managed to crack the glue on a few antique chairs after pounding away - like a fifteen pound hammer - until the dowels pulled apart. That solved the problem, no more damage - although it can be a bit disconcerting to see dining chairs moving a centimeter at a time as the Roomba pushes unseen at the legs..Yes, I have to remember to empty the bin every other day - but it's an easy habit to follow, and I'm always amazed by the amount of hair, biscuit crumbs, flotsam and jetsam that tumbles out. An occasional paperclip, pieces of paper, a pea, bits of styrofoam from packing materials that I missed seeing because I'm too lazy to wear glasses unless one of those blasted packaged food cartons is printed in green on a dark blue background in tiny print.The upshot is - I have a nice lady come in just twice a month to clean, she never has to hoover more than a few minutes, mostly in the areas the Roomba can't reach, like inside the larder, under the sofas and nightstands, behind the sectional seating in the living - and the dustbag only needs changing every couple of months. The floors are spotless (I also bought a Braava thingy that damp mops the hardwood and the tile floors in the baths every couple of weeks), and I figure the Roomba paid for itself in the first four months - including the costs of new filters every month, new swish brushes,, a new battery after two years and new rollers every six months, and a few dollars in electricity to recharge the battery, it costs only $15 a month to run.The dog now ignores the Roomba - just lays on one of  her big pillows and watches it bounce off things. Some say it is loud - but frankly, what are they expecting?  It isn't a loud as the big Hoover, or even the coffee grinder, and at 6 am who cares?Yes, I have to pick up, no clothes left in a pile in the bathroom or next to the bed. And I shut it off when overnight guests first arrive. BUT - no dust bunnies under the beds, floors ready for guests at any time, my brother who's allergic to pet dander and dust has no trouble when visiting, and if I want to sleep in,  there's a remote in the nightstand. As if my dog would let me wait too long - the Roomba won't take her out, and the other half has no intention of walking her before noon, would sleep through twelve Roombas in concert, snoring away blissfully.If this Roomba ever gives up the ghost, I'll gladly upgrade to the new top-of-the-line pet model - worth every penny. But it will be a sad day, laying the faithful little guy to rest."
1/26/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Good only in theory,"This is probably the least efficient way to vacuum.  It had a habit of going over and over the same area and when it did, it either just pushed around the dirt or didn't even pick it up.  We let it run fully charged when we left the house and even after a couple of hours it left about 50% of the dirt in an average size room.  I think I'll just stick with my little $15 Bissell 3 in 1 vac.  Best $15 investment I ever made in a vacuum."
7/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great Value.  Labor Saving.  Like having a cleaning service without having to supervise.,This is our third Roomba and it works as well as previous models in other homes.  The seek-and-return-to-charger-station feature is amazing.
7/30/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,... our third one over many years and it works better than any of the earlier versions,This is our third one over many years and it works better than any of the earlier versions.  We run it about every three days and it does a great job.  We have pets ion the house and it picks up a lot of pet hair.
12/29/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Our Third Robot over the years - We are highly satisfied.,"This is our third iRobot over the past eight years or so. We have had several models over the years. The 650 does a good job. Misses a few spots  occasion, but then so do I if I ever use a regular vacuum...which is maybe once a year.  The iRobot always does a good job. The 650 model will run for some 90 minutes non-stop before it needs to dock at its charging station. Well worth the money !  I would recommend the iRobot 650 to relatives, friends and neighbors."
07/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,You have to get this,"This is one of those items in life where you find yourself exclaiming, ""Why in the world did I not get this sooner?""I have dark wood floors, and used the swiffer on a daily basis.  Quite long ago (a few years after the emergence of Roomba), I had asked several Roomba owners for their opinion and what I normally heard was an unenthusiastic ""It's just ok.""  Hence I didn't bother purchasing one.Well, after 3 years of daily swiffer, I had had enough.  I did my share of research online, and have come to the conclusion that Roomba 650 would be most suitable.On my first use, I stared at the Roomba in disappointment as it looked to do a pretty sorry job not getting all the dust.  But I decided to stop staring after 15 minutes and left the apt.  When I returned, the floors were spotless.  This little machine has been a life changer.I do not use swiffer anymore.I certainly hope this wonderful machine lasts."
08/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Putting Cleaning Ladies out of Business.,This is one of the greatest technological achievements in human history. My house has never been cleaner. This thing is incredible! It got every speck of dust and dirt out of my basement.  I was also surprised that my puppy hasn't even barked once at it.
01/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great product,"This is one amazing device.  Cleans every inch of a room and does it well.  We've only had it for 1 month but no problems thus far.  There are some other models with more bells and whistles, but I can't see at this point how much is gained by those.  The 650 works great and just requires the push of a button"
3/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,keeps the dust and hair controlled,"This is not meant to take the place of heavy duty vacuuming but it keeps the hair and dust down substantially.  It is not near as load as a vac. and the fact that you can schedule it when to vac, like when everyone is out of the house, is fabulous!  Each day or morning we empty out the filter collection, so easy.  I have wanted one of these ever since one of my friends had one in her home, and she had tile floors throughout the house, except for the bedrooms.  Plus, she had two cats, yeup it definitely made a difference.  I choose this over the other brand mainly because of the reviews about the motor not being protected or sealed off from catching any hair.  Other reviewers who had purchased the more expensive model still rated this with 4.5 to 5 stars."
7/20/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"A must have for all pet owners, REALLY!!!!","This is my third roomba. I love them, huge fan!!!! This particular newer model has a better intake vacuum system & motor, plus better brushes and the dust bin works more efficiently. You do have to thoroughly clean them with each use, but if you have pets, you will love this model. I just pick up the smaller things in the room, and push the clean button, and you comer home to a super clean carpet or floor. What's not to love!"
5/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it!,This is my third Roomba.  Love it!
11/30/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Eliminates pet hair from floors and carpets,"This is my second Roomba, and it works great. I purchased this one to put on the second floor of my house to complement the other Roomba that runs on the first floor. The Roomba is scheduled to run once a day and runs for about an hour. It covers multiple bedrooms and a hallway, and sometimes a bathroom. It works well on carpet, hardwood, and tile. We have 1 dog (a shedding Lab) and 2 cats, and it has eliminated most of the pet hair issues we had around the floors of the house. It vacuums under beds and other furniture, and usually finds its way back to its charging dock when it is done. Occasionally it will get behind a door and push the door shut, trapping itself in that room. It fills its bin with mostly dog hair. I try to empty its bin every day, but it has occasionally run 3 days without being emptied, and worked just fine. It is very easy to empty the bin and emptying it takes less than a minute. The roller and brush only need to be cleaned about once a week - usually due to my daughter's long hair being twisted in them. Cleaning the roller and brush to clean takes about 3 or 4 minutes using the round cleaning tool. You can schedule it to run once a day, and it runs for about an hour each time. It is very easy to schedule. I have ours run when no one is home, because while it is not loud, the noise can be a bit distracting."
6/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Great ""Ms. Rosie"" robot!",This is my new best friend! Just let it go and it gets the job done.
12/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,Five-Star Product with a Fatal Flaw,"This is my kind of appliance and I basically love it, but it has one fatal flaw:  It is constantly getting stuck in the toe space of my base cabinets.  Wherever there is a rug in front of a base cabinet, for example by the kitchen sink or the guest bath vanity, there is not adequate space for the Roomba to fit.  When it encounters these spots, instead of backing off and moving on, it will ram, and ram, and ram itself into the space until it is permanently stuck there.  This is where I will find it when I get home from work.  On the days it is scheduled to run, I have to make sure all those rugs are folded up to keep the device away.  When I am home and can babysit it, I usually leave the rugs flat.  When it gets stuck and I remove it from the toe space,  it will often go right back to the same spot and ram itself stuck again.  I have to dislodge it sometimes three or four times in a cycle.  I am not sure if the firmware can be updated, but this is something that iRobot needs to address.  I should not have to redecorate the house to accommodate the Roomba.While this problem is major, I have no other complaints about the device.  It is easy to set up and program.  It nimbly negotiates area rugs on hardwood floors.  My house has never been cleaner.  I like a clean house, but I hate vacuuming it.  This thing fits my lifestyle perfectly.The first few times I ran it, the dust bin ended up chock full.  Now I just get a little ""chignon"" of dust each time it runs, so it is obviously doing the job.  A couple days a week, I stick it up in the bedroom.  I get a kick out of how it goes under the bed and gets that cleaned as well.  That never got vacuumed before (ahem!).If the base cabinet toe space problem could be solved, I would readily give it five stars."
04/09/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Better than the 500 series Roomba's,"This is my fourth iRobot Roomba, so obviously I like them.  The other three are the older 500 series model, only one of which is programmable.  Unfortunately one of the older ones died (would only go around and around in a circle), and the other older one the battery is dying on, so I'm almost down to this one and the other programmable one I have.This 650 Roomba is much better than the previous versions and the filter holds more dirt.  It's also easier to clean and the brushes don't get as filthy.  I have used it for a few months now.  Most of the time it doesn't get stuck and finds its way back ""home"" to the charging base.  However, if there are cords or things like stationary fans in the way it can get stuck on them and I come home to either a dead battery or the robot beeping a message.  At times it dies before getting ""home"".  It is programmable and here's the reason I haven't programmed it - whenever I heard my other programmable Roomba start up I'd have to go and stop it and clean it.  I know, you're supposed to clean it and empty the dust bin after it's done, but rarely did I remember to do that.  So, whenever I want to use it I first empty the dust bin, clean the brushes (don't clean the brushes over a garbage because the little yellow cover on one end of the brushes falls off into the garbage and I've had to dig in the dirt for it), and then I press the button to have it clean.  It comes with a virtual wall to keep it in a certain space if you want; I let it have full reign of the house because I figure what it doesn't clean one time it'll get the next.  This 650 also seems to run into walls more often, like it doesn't ""see"" that they're there.This is definitely a good tool to have (and fun to watch too; lol).  Unfortunately it's still not perfect, but it sure beats the alternative of having to actually vacuum!  ;-)"
10/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Good for keeping the floors presentable at all times,"This is my first robot vacuum so I can't compare with other models or brands. I find that this is great for the living room rug no longer being forever covered in cat fur, and the dining room floor no longer forever being covered in crumbs. It keeps the floors and rugs looking presentable at all times, instead of only immediately after a weekly cleaning. But it's not as good a vacuum as a good upright. I find that it's generally pretty good at staying out of trouble, we've had it for a couple of weeks now and only once did we come home and find it not sitting on its charger. It had gotten a charging cable tangled up in it, and had turned itself off. The cable was fine and so was the Roomba. It's also pretty good at covering all accessible areas, right up against walls, and most notably, underneath couches and tables and stuff where it's a pain to try and vacuum by hand. I read that the Roomba is supposed to map the floor space... I seriously doubt it's doing that. But I don't find that a detriment."
01/02/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,"Vacuums well, but is a rather dumb machine.","This is my first iRobot, it vacuums rather well, picks up lots of dog hair and overall does a decent job.  However there's a variety of problems with as I see it.  Primarily, this has to be one of the dumbest robots ever, it mindlessly moves around the house with no concept of any type of consistency or pattern.  It doesn't clean thoroughly, place it in a room and it may only vacuum a small portion of it, frequently going over the same spots.  In addition, if you have any black in your area rugs, carpet, it won't vacuum that as it detects anything black as being a cliff.Overall, it's just decent."
9/16/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it enough to buy a 2nd one!,"This is my 2nd Roomba that I bought for my son in law. With two dogs and two cats, they needed it!I bought the programmable one this time because I wished that I had that with mine.  The Roomba can get to places a typical vacuum an not easily reach.  Goes from floor surface to floor surface easily.  Amazing what it collects!"
8/20/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I love it. I was amazed about how much suction ...,"This is my 1st review ever!!  I read all the reviews and as most, very skeptical about spending this much money on something that sounds too god to be true.  I love it.  I was amazed about how much suction power this thing has for being battery operated.  I have dark (almost black) hardwoods, carpet and vinyl in our sunroom-it works great on all.  It goes over the area rugs nicely.  We both work from home, so we will usually turn up the barstools on the counters, chairs flipped over on the table and pick up around the house when we go out to dinner on Friday nights.  That's the most effort.  When I go get my son from school, I was turn it on just to see what it will do while I am away 30 mins.  Impressed!!  I have only done a deem cleaning twice. Which means, moving chairs and dust mopping all corners and places where Roomba cannot go-into middle of the room and then turn it on.  No more constantly b*tching about the floors and having to spend hours on Saturdays to clean them.  LOVE!"
11/30/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This is freaking awesome!! It not only picks up dust (fine ...,"This is freaking awesome!! It not only picks up dust (fine dust like my bag-less vacuum) and debris, but also CAT FUR (yes, so much that I have to clean out the motor after 2-uses), and CAT TOYS (lol)! It's worth every penny."
4/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Hail Our Drone Overlords,This is by far the greatest thing mankind has ever produced. I want 9 more.
5/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Don't wait to buy just buy it.,This Is by far the best thing I have ever bought on Amazon and nearly the best darn thing I have ever bought period. It is magical machine that I cant believe I waited so long to buy. My wife and I just had our first child and we found it difficult to keep up with the house like we wanted to. Then we bought a Roomba. We call it Hal. Hal is awesome. It cleans better then you can expect. We have transitions from carpet to wood and Hal handles them with zero problem. He charges himself automatically and will stay in an area longer if he senses it needs extra work. He will not fall down the steps and it is quieter then the average vacuum by far. The only thing left to do is waited for the rumba that mops floors. We love it we will always have a Roomba for ever.
12/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I love this more than anything in the world!,"This is by far one of the most amazing inventions since fire. We have two huge labs that shed like crazy, and we just had a baby. Who has time to clean their house, let a lone keep up with pet fur, plus your baby is always covered head to toe from crawling around in it.Buy this.I run this thing usually once a day. I close it off in the bedroom and let it go. Once I had one floor done (hardwood) I move it to another room and then I take my Bona mop and scrub, etc. etc. For the first time ever I am able to vacuum multiple times a week and scrub my floors once a week.Such a life saver. I did not buy the virtual walls  yet. I am running around blocking it in with a dog bed- but I'm just cheap for now. I will get them eventually. We have a super open floor plan so that is the only hard part. You should keep up with cleaning it once every three runs, if not more. That thing picks up so much dirt. Bought it at a department store on sale (which was the same price it was on Amazon) and it was a costly purchase so to determine if I wanted to keep it, I vacuumed my whole house with our vacuum and then ran the Roomba- SOLD. The carpets even smelled cleaner after it was done. I hope this thing lives for a long long time."
12/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Awesome.,This is awesome.
07/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing Product,This is an amazing product and worth the price! It works better than I thought and very modern looking. The only problem I have is that can get stuck under my kitchen toe kicks sometimes. But my floors basically stay clean now! P.S. A bit noisy so prefer running it when we are not home
7/13/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love!,"This is an amazing addition to our household. We have Flor carpet tiles throughout our home, two small children, a dog, and lots if open doors. Before Disco Velante, the name we gave our Roomba, our floors were always a bit dirty. Now they are ALWAYS spotless. We had to move the kitchen rug as he would get wedged between the rug and the base if the counters, but one 1/2 inch adjustment was all that was needed. Buy this."
3/13/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This works very well,"This is a well designed robot, it does a great job at cleaning hard floors and getting over and or around obstacles.  It is well made and super easy to figure out and program.  I am glad I bought it."
04/10/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba 650,"This is a very special product.It works very well, cleaning each little partof the fllor. Runs smooothly and it is easy to handle and clean."
6/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Terrible Design Flaw,"This is a terrible product.  I purchased it to help keep my wood floors clean.  It has scratched them, which will cost me a lot of money to fix. Poorly designed. I am returning it."
3/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Really good,This is a really good cleaner.  It sometimes needs resetting but you have to monitor it's can and cant's.
11/29/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,This is a problem!...Everybody likes it... Bought 4 so far... #5 coming up in Dec
10/21/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing,"This is a must have, the Roomba works great. It goes over rugs and stops at stairs, goes around things and just keeps going. It even goes ""home"" to recharge when the battery is low. You might still need a regular vacuum cleaner for corners and stairs etc, but this does the job on an every day basis. You will not believe how much dust and dirt gets collected in it. Easy to use and to clean. Our Roomba even went outside one time and sucked up leaves and small twigs... so keep your doors closed! Great item."

10/25/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Very cool, smart, and worth it!","This is a great little helper to our need for a daily quick sweep.  It at times gets stuck in places, but most of the time it will find its way back to the docking station.  I find it easier to pick up anything on the floor such as loose carpets and clothes prior to it's scheduled 9:00 AM start time and as long as I clean out the trap each day, it works great.  Have to say; what a cool invention!"
1/17/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great,This is a great little device for shedding pet owners.  I am constantly amazed at the amount of hair it collects daily.  Be sure yo room a proof your house before using. It can pull appliances down if it gets tangled in power cords and can get trapped under furniture. Otherwise let it rip and it does a terrific job.
10/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,This is a good tool for a busy family,"This is a good tool for a busy family. However I cannot run this when I am not at home. It always gets stuck somewhere in the house and it needs to be rescued. I have Flor carpet which was hard to be cleaned with my regular vacuum, but Roomba does a very good job cleaning it. There are pros and cons but it's still useful for a lazy wife like me."

The Roomba 650 exceeded my expectations in every way.  Our Roomba's Domain is our first floor which is an open concept about 700 square foot.  There are 3 area rugs, two area low profile but one is a high pile area rug with 1"" long or so fibers with a rug pad underneath, and tile everywhere else.  The roomba moves over and vacuums with ease on all of these surfaces.  It is quiet enough to watch TV at a moderate volume while you sit back and admire the work that it is doing that you don't have to.  In fact it works so well I may just buy another for upstairs.  One of the best purchases we have made.  You will not be disappointed."
5/23/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great product Love the way it works,"This I a great product.  No more dog hair in our house.  My wife is very impressed,  we all  notice the cleanness."
12/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It's almost like getting a maid but lots cheaper!,This has worked better than I could have imagined.  I read the reviews extensively and thought long and hard before paying this much for a battery powered vacuum cleaner but I can say after using it for 4 months it was worth every penny.  I feel like I got a maid!  It is set to run every day and most of the time I never know that it is working other than that the floors are just all clean.  I have nearly all hardwood floors and tile and they are cleaner than they have ever been and look great.  I have it covering most of my 2500 sq. ft. house.  Probably 3/4 of the time it cleans and re-docks itself.  Other times it does get stuck under the ledge of the cabinet in the kitchen which is just not quite tall enough or there are a couple of places that it gets into that it can't find it's way out.  Not really an issue though because you do have to remember to empty the dustbin anyway.  I recommend this to all my friends and if it ever goes out I'll definitely buy another.
11/24/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Don't wait any longer!,"This has turned out to be one of the best purchases I have ever made.  I run it everyday, as recommended.  It's easy to clean and rarely gets ""stuck"".  Our floors are so much cleaner.  I only wish I had gotten it sooner.  Anyone considering getting one of these needs to do it; don't wait any longer."
12/12/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I want to give more stars for my Roomba!,"This has got to be one of the best purchases anyone could ever make...whhhy would I choose a handheld???  I have my Roomba scheduled to run 4 days a week.  I have a long haired dog and a long haired cat.  The Roomba works beautifully!  I come home and the living room is perfect.  The only thing I have to do is remind myself to empty the dust tray and clean the brushes after every 2 runs...and make sure the kids take all toys off the floor every night so it doesn't suck up small parts.I have a busy life - single mom, 2 boys, work full-time, after school activities; homework, etc, etc, etc.  Vacuuming is now 1 less chore we have to worry about.Love it!"
9/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This has been the greatest purchase I have ever made,This has been the greatest purchase I have ever made. We have 6 animals and this little vacuum does such a great job with keeping up with all of the hair
12/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I highly recommend this product,"This has been a life saver cleaning up after  my corgi who sheds  non stop year around.  I only have to vacuum one a week my Roomba does the vacuuming for  me everyday.  I highly recommend this product, it is truly awesome."
12/14/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Amazing!,"This device really helps to keep the dust and pet hair down to a manageable level in our home. It works well on both carpet and tile and picks up virtually everything. Cons: It does get stuck in several places. Maybe in the future there will be a robot that can remember where it should avoid. If I don't start it from the base it often does not return to the base, but ends up stopping where it runs out of juice. The noise level is acceptable; somewhat quieter than our vacuum, but then it runs for a longer time. I was hoping to use it at night while we slept, but it's a little too loud for us.Cleaning: I use a HEPA mask and small needle nose pliers to unwind the pet hair from the numerous places where it gets caught. There are good suggestions on youtube and other places on ways to clean the filter (rather than replacing it) and do a deep cleaning. Removing the pet hair is not a fun chore and I find myself avoiding it in pretty much the same way I avoided vacuuming! The difference is that it really only takes about 10 minutes to maintain the Roomba after each use and my floors are much much cleaner."
7/20/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This Roomba is perfect,"This beast is awesome, powerful and smart.. kind of loud but beats lugging a heavy vacuum around all day. This thing gets EVERYWHERE and I mean everywhere. It finished my bedroom in about 15 minutes and left behind nothing. It is also very powerful with suction and in general, it actually knocked down the gate we had up to the kitchen and rode over it like nothing. It gets under all our tables/chairs without issue and hugs the corners of our kitchen cabinets really nicely so it gets to those hard to reach spots. This thing is pretty great, I thought it would need a lot of ""moving it out of stuck areas"" but have not encountered that once yet. After we first used it in our living room to test it out, I was shocked to see the amount of dust/cat hair it sucked up - it was jam packed with it. We didn't even think the carpet looked dirty but apparently it was, the suction must be really great on this. Welcome to 2015, you don't have to vacuum yourself they have robots for that now! What is so great about this machine is how much work and detail went into making it perfect, it is designed so well I really have no complaints about it. And I rarely say that about anything."

08/01/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Curmudgeon approved - sort of.,"There's enough reviews here to probably sway the typical dirty floor denizen but I will chime in regardless because I was in a quandary over which Roomba to buy. It was an important decision as my relationship hinged on it's success. My wife hates dirty floors almost as much as me. Read that sentence any way you wish.So after reading a few online reviews I came to understand that the 650 was the sweet spot of price vs. features. I'm happy to have saved a few bucks and I think it works just great. I can walk around the house in bare feet and not feel dirt or crunchies. My wife, ever supportive and encouraging, simply shrugged, ""Meh, you still have to vacuum and wet mop..."" That comment was just to make sure she didn't have to thank me for doing something nice. The real proof is that she no longer vacuums - at all."

He gets 5 stars, not only for being so great at vacuuming (picked up a couple bins full of dust and fibers even after a preliminary Dyson once-over) but also for the unexpected psychological benefit of making me happier while I'm cleaning."
5/29/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Fabulous product!,"There are lots of revues for all the different models that iRobot markets. I am not going to repeat what others have said over and over again. My opinion is to find the one that sounds good and BUY IT!I am a very picky buyer. But I also have a dog that explodes hair as she walks across the room. See picture that I uploaded. It has become tiresome to go to the local club, buy some chick a couple drinks, and then talk her into going home with me just so I can get the floors vacuumed. The Roomba has allowed me to automate the cleaning process that will provided payback within the first couple of months. If they would add a feature that would bring me a beer and clean the bathrooms, I would pay even more.Here are a few observations:Noise is minimal. I have the Roomba set up to run on autopilot at 5:30 in the morning. I do not find the noise bothersome at all.Roomba does very well on hardwood and tile. Does okay on carpet but I use the heavy duty vacuum weekly just to get further down into the pile. Roomba does not like rug fringe. Roomba HATES black carpet. Apparently this tells Roomba that she is falling down stairs. She tries to go the other way most of the time but sometimes just stops. Roomba can get tangled in cords so you have to Roomba proof by typing the cords up or you can tape them to the floor. It sounds laborious but its really not when you consider the ongoing labor savings.Roomba likes to close doors as she moves around and will trap herself in the room. I solved this by getting door stops that are magnetic. I actually like them better because I frequently leave the windows open and the doors no longer slam shut with the wind. Do a search in Amazon for Magnetic door stops.One of the things that attracted me to Roomba is that she is short but fairly large around. She fits easily in that space designed for womens feet under the kitchen counter. Roomba very efficiently picks up the crumbs that tend to gather there. Her heft means that she brushes the floor fairly aggressively. The only draw-back is that Roomba will not fit under some chairs if there are too many legs in close proximity to each other. My work-around is that I put the dining chairs on the table first and pull the bar chairs away from the bar to give Roomba the tail-swing room she needs to get the job done. Roomba will also clumsily knock over any light plant stands.My Roomba came with only one Virtual wall. You really need two or three. The virtual walls keep Roomba on task in a particular area. She wont crawl past the electronic barrier. Do a search for Roomba Accessories on Amazon and order a 2-pack.I know this sounds weird but Roomba is FUN to watch work. She rather randomly bumbles around exploring the room and twirling her little bristles. I find it endlessly fascinating to try to figure out what is going on in her simple little mind.The best part of Roomba is opening up the dust bin and seeing all the crap that she picks up while you are fixing dinner or watching a movie. The first time I ran Roomba was right after my floors were cleaned and I was SHOCKED at how much she picked up.I am going to order a second Roomba for the lower level of my house. That's how much I like it!"
12/31/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Dead on Arrival,"The unit was well packaged and seemed to have a good fit and finish. However, upon following the setup instructions, the unit would only charge for a couple of minutes then begin flashing an error code.  One other thing to note is that, aside from the vacuum itself, this unit has a speaker which makes noise (various beeps and error message narration). The noises are loud, can't be disabled and can be quite unsettling at night when you hear your vacuum talking to you out of the blue."
12/17/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,the EARLIER you enjoy. No need to sweat cleaning the house everyday,"The thing with IROBOT is that the EARLIER  you buy, the EARLIER you enjoy.No need to sweat cleaning the house  everyday."
8/20/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Works very well, although not 100% perfect","The short version: The Roomba works very well, but there are some minor issues.The longer version:For context, I have a 2 bedroom apartment (roughly 800-900 sq) and it's just me and a short-haired cat.  So, there's a fair amount of dust and hair, but no giant kid-related messes or anything.  It's doable to vacuum on my own, but I just hate doing it, so I decided to give the Roomba a shot.Pros:-Does a surprisingly good job vacuuming.  Gets probably 95% of the visible stuff on the floor (see below for more on this).  I've run it about 5 times now in 3 days and it is still picking up handfuls of dust and cat hair.  I was vacuuming about once a week prior to getting the Roomba, so it's clearly picking up a lot that my old vacuum was not.-It goes under beds/couches, which basically never get done with a regular vacuum.-It's surprisingly quiet.  You can easily talk over it and even watching TV I found that I only have to increase the volume a couple notches.-Runs for well over an hour, probably close to 2 hours, without stopping.-Does a good job of untangling itself most of the time.  It does run over cords, but it can usually untangle itself.  So far there's only been one time when it got so tangled that I had to rescue it.  It does not get tangled in the tassels of my area rug.-Goes over hardwood, carpet, and tile seamlessly.-Navigates pretty well.  It bumps into stuff constantly, but it usually corrects itself quickly and goes on its way.Neutral:-I expected it to do one area completely and then move onto the next area, etc.  This is not how it works.  It'll do one area and then randomly go into a different area, then another area, then come back to the first area and stay there for 10 minutes, then go to a new area for a few swipes, then back to another area, etc etc etc.  Sometimes it'll come into a room for 30 seconds and then not come back for 30 minutes, other times it'll come into a room and not leave for 10 minutes.  It hits almost everywhere eventually though, so it's fine in the end.Cons:-It probably gets like 90-95% of the stuff on the floor, but it is not completely perfect.  After it's done, I'll still find little globs of dust or cat hair here and there.  This is totally fine for a normal day, but if I were having company over and wanted a 100% spotless house without a speck of dust, I'd probably do a once-over with the regular vacuum.-Sometimes it bumps into a things a little too hard.  It's not that hard, so this probably won't be a problem for most people, but I noticed it because I have a set of ladder bookshelves that have tipped over a couple times when bumped into the wrong way.  The Roomba has hit them a couple times, hard enough for them to shift slightly (not hard enough for them to knock over, yet).Overall, I am very glad that I purchased it.  My floors are visibly cleaner once it's done its thing and it has picked up a ridiculous amount of dust and cat hair that I apparently was not getting on my own.  The only people that I would advise not to get it are people who want something to get every single speck of dust every single time.  I knocked one star off since I will still have to use my upright vacuum on occasion and because of the extra ""Roomba-proofing"" that I am going to need to do because of my bookshelves."
6/29/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba is a Game-Changer,"The Roomba650 has absolutely changed my life.My main floor is roughly 1500ft with a pretty open floor plan:  Bamboo Wood Floors (they're very light in color, so the dog hair was always visible and I hated it) and 3 area rugs. 2 dogs (both adult black labs) and 2 adults.My favorite thing about this vacuum is that I don't have the vacuum.  My second favorite thing is that it vacuums while we're at work.  I set it to run every day of the week at 2:00pm and when I come home, I empty what it has picked up during the day (30 seconds).  I clean the sweepers and bearings every 3 days.  It usually takes about 3-5 minutes.I thought I'd answer a few of the questions I had when I was reading reviews.1: The Roomba is about 1/4 as loud as our Dyson.  I once tried to watch an episode of Law&Order while it was running and I could totally still hear Tutuola and Benson by increasing the volume by 2. It's less loud than someone using a blender in the same room as you.2: My baseboards have never been so clean. It's true that it gets hair and debris off of the baseboards.3: As a result of the Roomba's hatred of cords, my house has gotten cleaner because I made sure to tidy all cords and remove clutter.  I saw this as a ""con"" on several people's lists.  Wait... so you're complaining because a vacuum forced you to keep your house cleaner?  You whine too much. Also, you don't understand what vacuums are for.4: The Roomba easily moves over thresholds between doorways and over our rugs.  We don't have tasseled rugs, so I can't attest to how it would handle those, but I did leave a quilt that I've been working on out on the living room floor last week, and the Roomba very sweetly vacuumed it for me without destroying any of it (thank god).5: It's unreasonable for you to think that the Roomba will pick up every single hair or piece of dirt every single time.  It's a robot, not a maid service.  If you see something the Roomba missed one day, trust me it'll get it the next.6: Once in a while (about once every 3 weeks) The Roomba will get trapped in my bathroom and I'll find it there when I get home. (To be fair, that bathroom is tiny, covered in floor mats and it's the farthest point from the docking station.  I didn't follow the rules on where to put the docking station.) If all I have to do to vacuum the house is move a 5-pound, 1-foot wide disc back to a docking base, I'd buy this thing all over again!  (also to be noted, I've never used the room barriers, and this has still only happened a handful of times.)7: You need to vacuum your house before you turn on the Roomba the first time.  You cant expect it to pick up all the junk that has been collecting since the last time you vacuumed.8: The bin seems small because you probably vacuum every 3 days(if you're cuckoo or have kids) or once a week.  But when something is vacuuming every day, the amount of debris is substantially less.9: I'm cuckoo, so I still Dyson the rugs every week or two because Roomba is AMAZING but it's no Dyson on the rugs. Roomba has cut the amount of time I spend vacuuming the house from 2 hours a week to 20 minutes a week.  It practically takes me longer to get the Dyson out than it does to use it.I've had the Roomba650 for 6 months and as of this moment I have no complaints other than that it can't have babies.  It's important to have a little perspective.  Too many people review this vacuum like it was supposed to be a butler.  Yes, it'll get confused by your chairs being close together, yes it'll get stuck on cords... but so will a regular vacuum.  It's not sentient.Science is AMAZING. Get one! It totally changed my life.  100% worth it."
02/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,It may sound like a cool purchase but its overly expensive and a ...,The roomba may be neat in the fact that it can get dust and dirt off your floor while you're out but its not really all that convenient. the company advertises that the roomba will map out the house and get every inch of the house a couple time over but it actually just goes in a random direction until it crashes into a wall and then it turns around and goes somewhere else random until it hits another wall. Often you have to supervise over it to make sure it gets everything. It may sound like a cool purchase but its overly expensive and a let down. Its not worth 400 dollars.
3/28/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great Product,"The Roomba lives up to the other 5 star reviews I read before purchasing this product. It's great, does just what they say it will do. I will never buy another kind of vacuum cleaner."

It went around the furniture fairly well too. For pet hair it did not work as well.  If you have short haired pets it would probably work well, however, I have several large, long haired dogs and while it captured some of hair, it blew alot of the hair around the room.  The dust caontainer is small and it filled iwth the hair it did capture really quickly.  I emptied it constantly and it could not clean more than two rooms without being overwhelmed."

It's a bit noisy, but not so bothersome that you couldn't listen to TV in the same room without turning up the volume.

My regular vacuum would never do that and so I would have to try to shake the cat hair out outdoors. This robot vacuums them and they look like new. I use this on tile floor, carpet and area rugs. Judging by the amount of pet hair I clean out of the compartment, it picks up a lot more than the regular vacuum. LOVE it."

8/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,"Worse, once it has voided such unfortunate starfarers by ...","The primary problem with the iRobot Roomba 650 Vacuum Cleaning Robot was choice by IRobot to employ the Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer 9000 operating system for a machine with really quite baseline processing requirements. This unfortunate choice not only drives up the price of the vacuuming automaton, but also renders it apt to methodically murder the astronauts unfortunate enough to be paired with it on long intrastellar voyages. Worse, once it has voided such unfortunate starfarers by exposing the crew compartment to raw vacuum, the primary purpose of the Roomba is obviated: its suction chambers annoyingly cannot function in deep space and the acoustic sensor is rendered useless, as no one can hear beeps or screams in space. D+ (the color scheme is nice)."
12/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER,"THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER! WE have our roomba set up downstairs on our hardwood floors, it runs every day and does a spectacular job, so noticeable. very through in its cleaning. it hits all of the nooks and crannies! I highly recommend it, as we own one dog and three cats. no more fur, debris on the floor!  My only piece of advice.. schedule it to run it when you're not home, not like its very loud, but... its nice when it shuts off."
8/27/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Misrepresented -- not automatic -- see comprehensive details below,"The manufacturer's description of the Roomba wildly misrepresents its capabilities. If you are looking for a product that will clean your house twice weekly and require no intervention, there is no such product.The Roomba only suffices as a semi-automated cleaner if the cleaning space is small and well-contained. It will not, for example, navigate its way well through a multi-bedroom house without intervention.The intended use of the Roomba is for you to decide which room you want to clean; to place the Roomba in that room; and then to push the clean button. It will beep when it is done, at which time you are meant to empty its bin.As an afterthought the manufacturer added the scheduling feature -- however if you do not monitor it, you will find the bin filling up, or the Roomba leaving out certain rooms almost completely.The Roomba does not follow a very intelligent cleaning pattern. It relies on randomly turning until it has covered the area sufficiently many times. This is usually way more times than is needed to clean. There are time lapse photos on the Internet of the Roomba's cleaning path. Do search. Mathematically, the cleaning pattern will do a pretty good job for simple areas, but most people have furniture arranged with little space for the Roomba to find it's way around. It was never designed to cope with that situation even though it's extremely common. Hence my 1 star review.There is no way to update or improve the cleaning algorithm.This Roomba is useful for a one or two room area not larger than 500 square feet so that it can clean both rooms entirely in a reasonable time (before the 2 hour battery limit) and also not have it's bin fill up.It is extremely sad that this product works so badly because it would be so easy to improve the cleaning pattern using software changes alone. Unfortunately the software is not upgradable or configurable.There are many positive reviews of the Roomba. They are all correct in the sense that, given certain limited expectations, the Roomba works quite well. However those are not the expectations set by the manufacturers advertising -Which is a lie."

12/03/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Not worth the money.,"The iRobot Roomba 650 vacuum is a cheap product. First of all, you will have to do more work than if you didn't have to use this vacuum because the vacuum gets full fast and the wheel gets stuck with pet hair every single day. The first day was the only time this robot worked, after that it was became louder and had to be maintained daily. It's just easier to vacuum with a regular upright vacuum. Also, after about 4 months of use the wheel became loose and the little rotating brush broke off. Now I have the iRobot sitting in the garage in a box. Save yourself some money and don't buy this. The idea was good but you end up spending more time trying to clean and maintain this little machine and you'll probably get less than a year of service before it starts breaking apart."
11/15/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Does a surprisingly good job,"The iRobot Roomba 650 is designed to vacuum dirt, dust, and other debris.  It easily picks up hair and pet fur.  In addition to the vacuum it has a side brush that cleans along the wall edges and corners and two counter rotating brushes that pickup dirt, dust, debris, and pet hair off the floor.  The Roomba works on carpet, hardwood floors, tile, and linoleum.  The virtual wall let you decide what rooms you want the Roomba to vacuum and what rooms you want left alone.  You can schedule the Roomba to clean at a time that is convenient for you - you can even have it vacuum while you aren't home!  It cleans under beds, around furniture, and avoids getting stuck on cords. It automatically recharges itself between cleanings.While I have the iRobot Roomba 780 and I am quite pleased with it, I was curious to see how the iRobot Roomba 650 works since it is labeled specifically for pets.  I have two cats and their fur seems to be everywhere.  I set the Roomba up in my bedroom because the cats like to sleep there - one cat in particular likes to sleep under my bed which is a major reason I wanted a Roomba because my vacuum won't reach under the bed.  I was a little apprehensive at first because the bin is a bit small and awkwardly shaped and I was wondering how much it could hold.  I was pleasantly surprised - it picked up a lot of debris and holds quite a bit before it needs to be emptied.  It does a great job of cleaning the area I want and the virtual wall keeps the Roomba exactly where I want it.  The only problem I had was that I didn't snap in the brushes correctly after I cleaned them when using the Roomba the first time and the Roomba kept starting and stopping. However, it was an easy problem to fix and purely human error.I find that the iRobot Roomba 650, while not as sleek looking as the iRobot Roomba 780, works just as well and it is now a permanent fixture in my bedroom where it does an excellent job of picking up and other debris.The iRobot Roomba 650 comes with the Roomba itself, home base, aerovac bin, one virtual wall, and an extra aerovac filter."
08/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Vanquishes all the dust bunnies hiding under the bed!,"The iRobot Roomba 650 does an amazing job with cleaning all the floors in my house. I set it loose the first day and off it went. It spent a lot of time under the beds, where it vanquished all the dust bunnies that had taken up residence and I'm sure thought they were safe! I feel like the entire house is also not as dusty now that the Roomba is vacuuming the floors every day.  And I like how at the end of its ""shift"", it returns itself to the base station to recharge for the next time."
11/06/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing!!!,The iRobot is amazing and easy to use. I love it. It is a great product. Recommended. The product also arrived in time. Great sellers too.
03/09/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,"Works well, with many limitations","The idea is clever. But it does not go into dark rugs (in our case, making it useless, since we bought it for those rugs specifically), gets stuck under sofas, and the cleaning pattern (the manufacturer's claims notwithstanding) is erratic, and it leaves many areas of any given room without a pass. If you live in a basketball court, or a ballroom (i.e. an empty space) this is the product for you. If not, be aware that it has limitations."
3/20/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Cleans Better than my Wife,"The headline says it all. We have all wood and tile floors, so the Roomba is a perfect vacuum cleaner for us.

02/04/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,It seems to clean ramdomly,"The advertise says the robot maps the rooms and learns its geography. Instead I observed that the robot passes over the same spot several times and does not cover some others. It returns to the dock only if the dock is near when it decides the work has been finished. I was expecting  something more intelligent, since cleaning the same spot several times is a waste o battery. That's the reason I've got desappointed. Other point is that the robot doesn't have a USB interface or something like that, so it will be impossible to upgrade de software in the feature, that means never I will have a intelligent algorithm to map the rooms!"
02/06/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing,"That's the one word that I would use to describe this.  I don't have to vacuum again. It's not that I don't like to vacuum, I just can't find the time. I work full time, and I have a farm, and between the two, I couldn't find the time. When there is something that needs done on the farm(which is always), the house cleaning always gets pushed to the back. So the only time it gets done, is when it's so bad I can't stand it. So this way, I can set the Roomba on a schedule to clean, and it does the job.  A good job it does too. I am just so impressed with how it works. It cleans good, picks up the dog hair, hay, mud and whatever else we may drag in. It does really well around my dining room table and chairs.  I watched it get tangled up in some shoe strings, and then get itself untangled. It also got stuck on a hammer laying in the floor, and again it unstuck itself.  I can't say enough about the cleaning it does.  I wasn't expecting it to do as well as it does.  I love it, and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't like to or have the time to vacuum."
03/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Read up before you commit to make sure Roomba is right for you.,"That sounds trite, but it's true. And because I could talk about this for days and days, I won't. However, after weeks of research and reading, the best article (and product comparison) BY FAR is here: http://thesweethome.com/reviews/the-best-robot-vacuum-is-the-roomba-650/. We have a similar home set-up (primarily hardwood floors with area rugs), and lifestyle, and the Roomba is a perfect fit. It is NOT, as the article states, meant to replace your stand-up vacuum. But we now use the stand-up once a month as opposed to once a week thanks to the Roomba. Have a home with multiple floors? The Roomba has a handle that you can use to pick it up and physically move it yourself. Magic! You've solved that problem. Sometimes the Roomba has even more of a mind of its own (we press the ""Dock"" button and the Roomba might happily zoom around for another hour before docking), but overall it's amazing. The cats don't care about it (one day, they shall ride!), and the kids love it (we're like the Jetsons now).  And spot cleaning isn't something I have to lug the stand-up vac out of the closet for anymore."

2/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,The good news is that it seems to do a pretty ...,"Takes a couple of weeks to find all of the things in your house that might not play well with the Roomba (electronic cords on the ground or anything else that could get caught up in the brushes, lighter/wobbly things that the Roomba might push around or knock over, etc). The good news is that it seems to do a pretty quick job of recognizing when it's tangled and stops before doing any damage to the item or itself. And once you account for those things (get them up off the floor or hide them behind the invisible wall) the Roomba works great. We have dogs and having this run 5 times a week has knocked down the amount of visible dog hair to just about nothing. It's pretty nimble too - I navigates through our table and chair set just fine even though the chair legs are just barely wider than the Roomba itself. Basically the only places it doesn't get to are those where it can't fit under something (we have couches that sit really low to the floor, entertainment center, etc).It's pretty quiet for a vacuum but still loud enough to be distracting. Luckily it lets you set it to run on a schedule so we just have it run during the week while we're at work."

It will not replace your Dyson super-vac.Also it will not drive over ledges more than 0.5 to 1 inch high.It will though, programmable to run any day(s) of the week, provide daily maintenance and keep your house looking clean and refreshed.  I am surprised how much it does pick up, even on a seemingly clean looking hardwood floor.Also if your space is cluttered, tight, with lot's of ""stuff"" all over the floor, the Roomba will have a difficult time navigating efficiently through the diversions.All around, very satisfied and glad to have had made the investment."

11/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,"Very good overall at cleaning, when it works and does not stop on dark carpets","Summary: Very good at cleaning overall, when it works and does not stop on dark carpets!  The competitor Neato Botvac fits my need more than the Roomba overall, although still not perfect. I also cannot speak to durability/reliability yet since I have only had it a few weeks and just sent it back. More details below:Improvements needed:IMPROVEMENT 1.  Cant go over dark rugs - this was the biggest for me and why I could not keep the Roomba, what good is a vacuum that stops on dark rugs? Yes, it would just stop, sometimes avoid, but eventually just stop since it would try and hit the same area again, dumb thing.  I use schedule mode hoping to clean while gone, have a lot of dark colors and strips in my multiple contemporary area rugs in my home, and I would need 4-6 virtual walls to make it avoid my rugs, or buy new rugs which is silly. instead, I let it go everyday and it was a gamble on whether it would stop or not. I called customer service, not willing to provide much of any help and they apparently know of this issue, I asked why this was not disclosed and they stated it is not a limitation with the machine to perform, it is safety feature (to keep it from going downstairs) just something that the consumer must consider only if and when the problem arises with this feature. OK so I do not have stairs, why not disclose the possibility it mistakes dark rugs for stairs especially if it is quite high in this situation? Just like the drug commercials about potential side effects? There is no mention in the manual or on their website or a workaround.  If I would have known, then I would not have tried it. If it is valid and common complaint, why not have a button to override?  Or better yet, FIX IT!  It has been a problem in numerous models for many years now, I saw a Youtube regarding it dating back to 2007 when flip phones were in style!  Also, I do not have stairs, what safety factor am I risking? Also, even though IRobot Roomba does not advocate it, I tried the hack/fix by deactivating sensor putting foil, glossy white photo paper and reflective tape on the underside sensors. Tried very many times and could not get it to work. I would get the error repeatedly ""move Roomba to a new location and press clean"". Not sure how all the consumers out there got it working? Is there different firmware/software in the newest shipments? Is my foil not shiny enough? Doesn't matter, I don't accept putting duct tape on a machine I paid hundreds for anyway, it is the manufacturers issue to resolve, not the consumer.IMPROVEMENT 2. Dumb proximity sensors- it tends to be rough knocking into items such as chair legs, vases, anything that is basically not a wall or similar to a wall.  Note that Roomba appears to start its program in a spiral and then employ an algorithm to create unique trajectory to bounce around in a star pattern (from birds eye view) with minor changes every time it hits an obstacle to ensure it does not keep covering the same exact area. There are sensors that sense the wall and will slow the Roomba down, make it move along side it or around certain items but not before bumping or slamming into them. This may be effective overall in cleaning an area eventually, but it is dumb technology in terms of versatility and innovation. Each time you press the ""clean"" button on a Roomba, you do not know what you are going to get or where it will go.  Each time it finishes a session, it starts back over again and the random number generator sends it in a certain direction.  Neato has an excellent system for sensing and navigating the floor plan and prevents bumping into objects harshly.IMPROVEMENT 3.  Needs to be More Efficient Both in Power & Movement/Pattern- Its onboard sensory detection / navigation is poor in sensing areas it needs to get to and is capable of getting to.  It seems to get itself into places and knock and bump around a lot, then later it will go there again. I have seen it pass through some areas 3+ times in a session, twice is reasonable, but 3-4 times is just a waste of the devices time and puts more wear and tear on it (battery and mechanisms) and my furniture for no additional benefit.  Also speaking in terms of battery life, it appears to run about an hour new, which is not long enough for a larger home since it passes over the same areas multiple times and misses others.  I also understand this could be run multiple times in a day but not knowing what it has and hasn't cleaned does not help much besides ""hoping"" it got everything while I was gone.  I do not want this thing running so often over and over.  If nothing else, it should run for longer to further ensure it got more of the floor, but it is still a waste of energy, No human would cut their grass or vacuum the house in this manner, this is why it is not artificial intelligence (which is supposed to replicate human nature), it is just a combination of applied physics and dumb luck that things get cleaned.Here are the PROs Compared to Neato Botvac:PRO 1. Drive system is very good, never gets stuck (except for the dark colored rugs due to cliff sensor problems).PRO 2.  Dock size and Docking feature is really great.  Set the Roomba in the vicinity of the Dock, Hit the button and it docks itself.  The NEATO Botvac requires you to set it into the dock.  The Roomba I could store under a dining room buffet and keep it out of site. The Botvac charger is too tall and bulky to fit under it, even if it could I would have to reach down under it to push it into place.PRO 3.  The randomly going over the same spot on floors numerous times in a single session which will likely (although somewhat randomly) pick up more in a given area than Botvac which only passes over each spot 1 time.  This makes it more effective in overall cleaning if you run it all the time and I have to give it that much, although not too efficiently since the battery is constantly charging and discharging.Lastly in terms of cost and models and if you should choose - If you do not have dark carpets, it is worth trying a Roomba. Also note the Roomba is slightly more noisy, but that was not an issue for me since I basically ran it while away.  Although I like the Botvac 80, the Botvac 80 (less the ""D"") and Roomba 650 are about the same price right now. I could not find a difference between the 650 Roomba device and the 630 & 770 in terms of main cleaning device  The 630 does not have schedule feature and the 770 adds a HEPA filters, yet there is a big difference in the price. The 880 / 980 double the price.  In all honesty, the 650 is probably the best bang for your buck in the Roomba line and the performance of the next models up will most likely not be more than a 10% improvement in cleaning/convenience but for double the price which really does not make sense.  To target  well informed consumers, I think they need to rethink their pricing strategy, this is not an Apple device.."

8/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Brief Review,Still being evaluated. But a simple wireless link for established functions would be a great improvement.More later.
08/04/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Buy it!,"So worth its money! My hardwood & carpet floors look like new. Love the programmable function, I run it every morning to keep up with 2 shedding dogs."
9/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Day one, thumbs up :)","So this will be long but worth it. I plan to update this as time goes on. This is our first day with Roomba. I let it charge fully as the quick start guide said to. Once I got the green light with the OK, I sent rumba out into the wild. I did not use any of the blocking sensors for the first time. I wanted to see just what roomba could do. So after stalking it all over my house, I have to say it will never be as good as me, after all I am woman I am the best. But I will say it will definitely make my work week easier. I have 3 cats a golden retriever and a Maltese. That is a lot of hair. I did not vacuum prior to letting it do its job tonight because I wanted to see just what it was capable of handling. After it had run its course it did return to its docking station which I have to say was pretty entertaining to watch. Since I have done like everyone else and read a million and one reviews and watched a million and one videos I have decided I will use the schedule but it will be run while I am home just in case of a fire hazard, as the wife of a fireman this is very important to me. Overall I will say just like everyone else has stated this will not replace vacuuming all together but if you were like me and  vacuum  multiple times a week and do your floors on your hands and knees every weekend this will make it to where you can spend more time doing what you need to do at home with your family instead of vacuuming every other day. On another note I did follow the recommendation of another reviewer and place a piece of electrical tape on the plastic rolling wheel to protect my hardwood floors from scratches after watching it go around tonight I will also be buying small circular felt pads to place around the bumper system just to keep any additional scratching and damage to my floor boards at a minimum."
10/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,YEAH!!!,"So I've only used it twice, but let me tell you that I LOVE it. Two days prior to receiving this in the mail my home was professionally cleaned. I decided to run the roomba despite this just to see if it would find anything else to pick up. Well let me tell you! After running it downstairs i went to check on the trash canister and it was completely full!!! I couldn't believe it! It's able to get under sofas and other low lying furniture so I suppose that's where it picked up most of its contents. But I was really impressed! I then ran it upstairs and had the same experience. I think me and this roomba are going to live very happily together. They say money can't buy you happiness, but to that I say you must not have a roomba in your life."
1/31/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,If you hate sweeping for hours and/or hate stepping on pet debris,"So i was not sure how well this would work... if you have pets, you need this device.  Should have bought sooner.  In the last week alone, every day this thing picked up an absurd amount of hair and dirt from our laminate floors - which we thought were rather clean.  If you hate sweeping for hours and/or hate stepping on pet debris, this is your solution...  Automation where it makes sense...Only gripe is that it does not have an app, so I can't watch it run around the house terrorizing my cats unless i come home and physically turn it on."
1/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Finally control over dog hair!,"So I actually didn't purchase my Roomba 650 on Amazon, but I used Amazon for the reviews prior to purchasing so I figured I should give my input here to help out someone on the fence like I was. We purchased it through Bed Bath and Beyond with a 20% off coupon which saved us about $60. I have wanted a Roomba ever since rescuing my German Sheppard/lab mix. While she is a beautiful dog, she sheds like no other dog I have ever seen. In a given week, I have to deep vacuum my entire house at least 2 times in order to have control over the hair. If I happen to go a week (god forbid!) everything is covered in dog hair and you literally have to jump over tumble weeds of dog hair. It drives me crazy and is so embarrassing. So this past weekend, I purchased this product. We have used it the last 4 days and I already see such a huge difference!! It has been five days since we actually used our vacuum and the hair is barely noticeable!! Not a single tumble weed of dog hair anywhere. On top of that, the Roomba is able to get under our bed and dressers- places I am rarely able to get to without major difficulty. We bought it on a trial basis thinking that we would probably end up returning it because it wouldn't be able to keep up with the dog hair. But I have to say, we will never return this. I was also worried that it wouldn't be able to do the job like one of the higher priced models. Now I have never used any other one so I can't say they wouldn't do just as good or even a better job. But this one is perfect for us. It was better priced and does an amazing job. I can't even begin to tell you how happy I am when I leave for work in the morning and I hear this Roomba vacuuming around my living room sucking up all that dog hair! I am completely satisfied and I am sorry I waited so long to buy one."
08/07/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,So happy that we have a Roomba in our house again,"So happy that we have a Roomba in our house again!  We had series 1 many years ago and were somewhat pleased with it.  We've got this one running constantly and it is doing a great job.  So far, he finds his home dock every time.  He does not get tangled up in wires-believe me ,we have plenty and the animal kingdom residing in our home (2 cats, 2 dogs and 1 bird) all find him mildly amusing.  My 18 month old grandson was mildly startled the first time he turned him on and he came out of his docking station-but got over it quickly."
12/07/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love!,"So far, I love this product."
1/20/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Second time around is better!  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.,"So far, 4 1/2 stars.I purchased the 650 2+ years ago and didn't like it at the time.  It missed a lot of areas, etc. and I just wasn't impressed.  I returned that one.Fast forward to now.  We have a different dog who sheds like no other.  Pair that with everyday tracking in of dirt, and I have been desperate to not have to vacuum every single day.  I decided to give the Roomba another try.  So far, I am glad that I did.I don't know if my first Roomba was a bad one, or if these have improved over the last 2 years (same model both times).  However, this time the vacuum goes everywhere and does an excellent job of cleaning!  It even goes into one room off the hall that had been completely ignored by the first Roomba.  This one also does not slam into things like the previous one did.The amount of dog hair it picks up is impressive.  The dust amount is even crazier.  It's picking up much more dust than my hard floor vacuum (our house is mostly hard flooring).  It transitions onto our area rug from the tile without a hitch.Here's my only downside so far:I really wanted to run this overnight so we'd wake up to clean floors.  In addition, our dog would be in his room and away from the Roomba (he is not a fan).  However, this thing lurches over our 1 ft. tiles like a zombie.  Every time the front caster wheel hits a grout joint, it thuds.  It was enough to wake me at 2:15 a.m.We've decided to just run it before bedtime and give the dog a safe haven elsewhere."
12/07/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Overall, satisfied.","So far we like the Roomba.  It does have a few ""glitches.""  For some reason, it get stuck on the area rug in our dining room.  It gives the ""move to another location and restart"" error.  I'm not sure why it does this, but it isn't a deal breaker.  On the hard wood floors and the tile floors it does a surprisingly good job.  Watch out for cords.  It will choke on phone cords if it gets hold of one."
4/23/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,2 months of daily use and still love it,"So far we have used our Roomba 650 for 2 months and it is working great.  We purchased this at BB&B with a coupon (which is why I'm not a verified purchaser).  With its programmable mode it has been run at least daily every day for the last two months.  I'll try to touch upon all the common pro's and con's that are mentioned most frequently.My pro's- Noise....is it whisper quiet, no.  But it is significantly quiter than a standard upright vaccuum.  You can have it running in the same room or next room and have the TV on or have a conversation without having to have the volume at max or screaming at another person.- Coverage....it is great in that it can get under couches, beds, tables, and around chairs.  If you leave the coverage to more than a room, it may pick up 80-90% of the dirt.  If you run it again in the same room the next time, it will be completely cleaned up.  If you leave the roomba to only one room you shouldn't see any left over dirt.  You will see a significant amount of dirt cleaned up with each running.- Automation...the ease of scheduling the roomba to run at any time of the day is virtually fool proof.  We have our set to run at 1am every night.  With the bedroom upstairs and the roomba running downstairs we don't hear a thing.  Also if you place the charging home base receiver in a good place it returns at the end of the cleaning back to its charging base.- Multiple surfaces...The roomba does a great job with carpets, hardwood floor, or tiles.  It has no problem with moving from a hardwood floor to a carpeted area.My Con's- Accessories...if you are trying to do more than one room at a time you will likely have to buy some additional acceessories such as a virtual wall or halo.  But if you have a fairly closed floor plan/apartment the single virtual wall that comes with the 650 should be good enough- Sensors...Overall the sensors work great, but the msot noise that you hear is the roomba running into narrow leg/table chairs.  The roomba has a soft touch for walls/hanging fabric from bed or couches.  But if the furniture has a narrow leg (I think I read it has to be 3 inches wide for the sensor to see a leg) it will bump into the leg a normal speed.  With table and chair legs this is where you can get the most noise with it eventually escaping the legs.  Also if the home base is hidden in a corner or next to a large item it may not always find the home base, we occasionally find it in the middle of the floor because it couldn't find the home base.- ""Frequent"" cleaning....After your first use in any room you will have to empty the bin as it will be getting to areas that you don't normally clean.  The bin is relatively small so you will have to empty the bin every 2-3 days, and clean the brushes about once a week.  This is a change for people who are not used to doing this with their standard vaccuum's. Although this is all easy to do it is just something that you have to remember to do.Overall we love our roomba and would get another one if this breaks."
05/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Impressed this sceptic,So far this little guy is wonderful.  I've only had it a day.  I've set it to clean twice and was impressed.  No this will not replace you cleaning the right way.  It is not perfect in the corners.  I'm still trying to figure out what it's cleaning pattern was in the bathroom.  But was very impressed in it cleaning hard floors and area rugs.  I will update this review after using it a few months.
5/29/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Not amazing but major time saver,"So far so good. It's been a month. The Roomba does a mediocre job at vacuuming, but since it means that I don't need to vacuum but I get the benefit of mostly clean floors and carpets, I win."
5/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,So far so good. Although it finds a step and stops,"So far so good.  Although it finds a step and stops, it simply stops and says there's an error.  You have to go move it and set it to go again.  It's not a huge problem, and as long as remember to use the virtual wall that came with it it's fine.  Works well both on hardwoods and carpet."

1/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it!,"So far it's been a great help. It maintains the floors between cleanings.  We have two active dogs, boxers, and it picks up their short hair and lots of dirt!  Cleaning it is easy as well.  I haven't let it run without being home so I don't know about the programming part and how that works.  But I have watched it return to the docking station when it's ready to recharge!  Love it!"

Outside of getting stuck every now and then, for everyday floor maintenance I'm a happy buyer.  Run Roomba every day and save vacuuming for the weekend.  Time will tell how the components and battery hold up but so far so good."

It's amazing how much it picks up and returns home (dock) when she's finished.  I will always own one!  My floors always look and feel clean!

12/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I named her Samantha,"Samantha was a hard broad to understand at first but later on she became an open book. Literally. A manual comes with the robot that would tell you everything to know about her.  She had some difficulty at first negotiating all the obstacles in my one bed room apartment that has a lot of furniture ;  so for a week or so , she lost her way back to the dock and ran out of charge midway. Though she did clean every step of the way , it was evident from the clean trails that she was lost. Poor thing.After a week, Samantha found her way back to the dock so no more sleeping off out of charge inside the cupboard , under the bed, chewing toilet paper and garbage. Moving furniture still confuses her like an 90 year old on dementia so give her some time and she will be the house maid you always wanted."
01/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great product if you have pets,"Run this sucker a few times a week and you can say goodbye, at least temporarily to pet hair.  Does a nice job of navigating around furniture, but it works better if you take a few minutes to remove things it can get caught under such as kitchen chairs.  It also helps to block off one room at a time to let if focus on cleaning smaller areas.  Our rooms are fairly large and we have an open layout, so this is necessary.  I usually just use the chairs or a few couch pillows to restrict the area and all's well. Does a great job of negotiating around furniture, walls, etc., but can get hung up if you have a bunch of tight spaces.It's amazing how much stuff this thing picks up and how long it operates on one battery - about 45 minutes.  Negotiates hardwood and carpet well, but struggles to get over one rug that has a thicker pad than the others.This thing is cool.  Our dogs like it and so do we."
11/05/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,One Star,ruined my wood floors!
03/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Do your family a favor and buy a Roomba!,"Roombas work well and demonstrate a well executed intelligent and thoughtful design process with appropriate materials choices. Battery life is excellent - Roomba does a lot of work between charges. Results are better than if you or a cleaning service worked on your floors will dust mops, brooms and vacuum cleaners. Lots of bang for your bucks.Important note - unless you have a really strong inner Nerd or live in a museum I suggest you ignore custom programing options and just set it down, push the start button and let Roomba do its thing. You and your family will be happier if you do.Routine maintenance is simple and requires very little in the way of tools (We are on year four of Roomba ownership and have been able to perform maintenance and module replacement with #1 and #2 Philips screwdrivers and a small set of precision screwdrivers).  The folks at iRobot are a shinning example of the best in product engineering. I am notorious for nit-picking product design and can't find anything about Roomba or iRobot that needs to change. Replacement modules and parts are modestly priced. Brief aside - several ears ago iRobot improved the design of their brush module and it was a real improvement (as opposed to a gratuitous move to charge an inflated price for not much of an improvement)! There was no extra charge for the improved module. The improved module was incorporated in all production going forward.My wife and I both work full time jobs and used to spend most of Saturday cleaning house. Our Roombas do a much better job of cleaning our floors than we can using dust mops, brooms and vacuum cleaners. Roombas work great on carpeted and hard floor surfaces. Prior to replacing the carpet in our bedroom with hardwood flooring we ran the Roomba through three complete battery charges and it was STILL picking up lots of cat hair that our conventional vacuum cleaner (a Windsor XL - a really good vac) left behind."
9/21/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Great vacuum, reliable, excellent on hardwood floors and carpet","Roomba- to put into words the joys you've brought me! Besides being an amazing vacuum, the scheduling is one of my favorite parts. Since this Roomba is a bit noisy (I can still talk to people or hear the television), I prefer to schedule the Roomba while I am at work. I have 2 cats and have to keep their liter box downstairs on the main floor, and they have a tendency to track cat liter on my hard wood floors. Roomba solves that for me! I come home to a completely clean, no mess home.My suggestions:1. Pick up any stray cords off the floor- they can get twisted in Roomba's brushes and you'll find a stalled Roomba when you get home.2. Roomba does not like shag carpet, so you will have to keep your regular vacuum for any tall shag carpet.3. CLEAN YOUR BRUSHES! I clean mine weekly and purchased the replacement kit, and you can totally tell the difference between dirty, tangled brushes and clean or new brushes.4. Try to make the path as open as possible. Roomba is completely random in its route, so if you have less of a maze for Roomba to go through, it will spend less time bouncing around running into things, and more time cleaning."
10/09/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Roomba, roomba, roomBA!!","Roomba, roomba, roomBA!!We have a large house and we've had 7 of these robots over the last 13 years for different levels of the house - they all took a beating to be sure. One of my 8 year old's 1st words was roomba, and when we fly to Aruba she STILL to this day says ""we're going to aroomba!""Yes, they break down; yes, they need regular maintenance; yes they're expensive. But if you use it daily and clean it out, you will have a cleaner house with far less work."
10/01/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Will not vacuum dark colored surfaces!,"Roomba's used to work great. These new models ex: the 650 DO NOT vacuum dark colored rugs. I contacted customer support and they told me, ""the robot will not be able to clean the rug because of the color"".  Buyers beware. Don't waste your money."
9/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,"Roomba works great, however don't forget to clean out the bristles every week or so."
12/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great Vacuum with only a few minor set backs,"Roomba works great on our hardwood floors. I have to run this guy every other day to help the battle on pet hair and it does a fairly good job. I have had the roomba for almost a month now and it definitely gets smarter over time. At first it took a long time to find the docking station but it knows its ""home"" now. After it runs a cleaning cycle I may have to get a few corners it missed but all in all it helps me out by not having to sweep every day and waft the pet hair around.We also have a few rugs around the house and it nicely transitions from the hardwood to the rugs. We have shaggy carpet upstairs and I haven't tried it on that yet, I think it would be too long for it.The one con to the roomba is you really have to pick up your house before it starts. You have to make sure there are no cords in the way for other things for it to get stuck on. Also one time we ran the roomba and left the house and it knocked over a ladder shelf we have in the hallway. Thank God the damage was minimal because I had some nice glass votives on it. Some how it went under the bottom shelf, got stuck, and backed out and pulled the shelf out with it. So now we will not be running it when we are gone. Also the roomba is pretty loud. I know the directions say you can schedule a cleaning cycle to run at night but it bangs around on stuff in our house that I don't think I would be able to sleep."
1/30/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Should have gotten this sooner,Roomba works great on hard wood floors. Very easy to program. Easy to clean. Works good on carpet. I love that it cleans under the bed
04/03/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great lite vacuum,Roomba vac arrived on time.  It was well packaged.  It does a great job picking up most dirt and pet hair.  It takes much longer to complete the job compared to a conventional vac because it doesn't stay in 1 room to finish the job.  I just let it go for 1 hour while I'm doing something else.  That's what is nice is it frees you up to do other things.  There is a more expensive model that claims it stays in 1 room until it is done before going to another room but the cost was more than I wanted to invest.  I really love the Roomba.
10/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Love my Roomba,Roomba rocks for keeping the dirt manageable.

9/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba is one of my absolute favorite items of all time,"Roomba is one of my absolute favorite items of all time. As a cat owner I always have to stay on top of the cleaning. This really does pick up a lot of dirt and hair, and does a great job of the daily maintenance floor cleaning. I don't use the scheduling options because I prefer to run it when I'm around, but it is so easy to just step on the big center button to turn it on and let it go.It really does clean the whole floor and it does ""learn"" the area. It goes over my hard floors, carpet AND an area rug nicely. It does not replace regular vacuuming and sweeping, but for daily floor maintenance, this thing is a real time-saver. It travels well and could seemingly last forever."
1/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Your home is not truly clean until it is Roomba Clean!!,"Roomba is my new best friend!!!  I love Roomba. I was reluctant to get a Roomba because I really didn't trust that it would be able to clean my floors as well as I do, I am neat freak.  However, I have to say that this is the most amazing gadget that I have every owned.  I love it so much and rave about it to all my friends that I now feel that I should be the new spokes woman/sales woman for Roomba because 8 of my friends now own one because of my recommendations.  I even loaned it to a very skeptical friend for the day.  She has a shedding dog and had just had her house professionally cleaned that day, I told her that I didn't think it was truly clean until it was Roomba clean.  She was ""floored"" by how much more dirt Roomba was able to pick up, no pun intended, Roomba managed to fill a whole cartridge of dirt and then I charged it and brought it back the same day and it filled up another cartridge. She was so impressed that she bought a Roomba and now only has her cleaning lady come every other week, and told her not to waste time on her floors, because Roomba's got it taken care of.My favorite thing about Roomba is that my floors are cleaned every day, which drastically reduces the dust in my home and I find myself dusting far less (from twice a week, now only once every other week), I also found that my intake filters need to be changed less often.  I only bring out my regular vacuum about once every 2 weeks, to areas that Roomba can not reach (behind the toilet, in cabinets, in small closets, on pantry shelves, etc.)Sometimes, I run Roomba twice in a day, for instance during the Christmas holiday, I would run Roomba before the party and then again after all the guest would leave.  Now, seriously, who likes to vacuum every day, or twice a day, NO ONE!  But for some reason, Roomba never complains, and even sings a sweet little song every time it's done for the day and returns to base.Roomba you are simply amazing!"
12/01/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba is cool,Roomba is great.It cleans great and it is so cool.Romba 650Is the best.When Romba is charged it has a green light.

06/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,Roomba is back !!!
10/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,5 star machine with a 1/2 star life,"Roomba is a 5 star machine with a 1/2 star life. We just buried our 4th Roomba in 7 yrs :(  Two had charging errors, and the last two had broken gear issues so the rollers couldn't turn to collect the dirt/hair. You may ask why someone would be so foolish to continue spending so much money on something while expecting different results each time, and you're right. The thing is, when Roomba is alive and well, it is your best friend. We have 2 cats and 2 dogs, Pergo, and low pile natural fiber area rugs. I was amazed at how the bin would fill up every day. It makes you realize how dirty your home is if you don't sweep every day (like mine is now). I haven't read all of the top reviews, but I imagine that they wrote them a little too soon-right before theirs died.PROS:-Keeps your floors looking a lot cleaner than you probably would, which takes your house to a whole new clean level-Programmable-Runs for about 2 hours before returning to base-Even though it's a rip-off, $350/18mon= ~$20. It's like giving Roomba a monthly allowance while it does a better job than your kid AND it doesn't give you attitude.CONS:-Life span of about 18 months on average for the 4 we owned-Bumper does leave black marks on white baseboards (Magic Eraser takes off)-WAY overpriced for the life spanNOT NECESSARILY CONS BUT GOOD TO NOTE:-You still have to vacuum your rugs once a week. It cleans the surface, but doesn't use suction. It works kinda like that manual sweeper they use in restaurants.-The noise is tolerable (quieter than an upright vacuum), but I definitely can't sleep through it, talk on the phone, or watch tv in peace.-I scheduled mine for 11am so I had time to dust, clean off the kitchen counters, and pick up Roomba's favorite snacks (earbuds and panties) off the floor.-If you're getting this to keep the area under your bird cage clean, don't. I found it very inefficient with that.-It has a high profile like all robotic vacuums and doesn't get under some pieces of furniture. We stacked felt pads under a couple of furniture pieces and voila!-We had trouble with one of them not returning to base until we moved the base over a few inches to clear our kitchen island. It needs to be placed in a more open area and not around a 'corner'.-It does tend to do a better job in zones rather than just letting it loose in the whole house.-You do have to empty it after every use. We didn't mind that, since that's much quicker than sweeping the whole house, but it seems to annoy some others.-If you have a walk-in shower, it doesn't discriminate. We learned to close our bathroom door so it wouldn't go in the wet shower and make a mess.-If I ever buy another one (because I'm cra cra) it will be from Costco because of their awesome return policy. There seem to be several complaints in the reviews about the terrible customer service/warranty from the manufacturer."
05/06/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Fairly amazing piece of technology,"Roomba has gotten a lot better. This model operates pretty well, picks up most stuff from the carpet. The automatic timer is sweet, expect when your dog poops on the carpet when you're not home and then it goes and smears it all over your house and coats the innards of the Roomba. Careful about that."
2/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Exceeded Expectations,"Roomba has far outdone our expectations. We have hardwood, rugs, tile, and carpet in our house. Roomba manages to clean all surfaces quite well. With three indoor cats and a large dog, we get our fair share of pet hair on the floor. We run roomba most everyday, and it does a fantastic job. I would definitely recommend it."

09/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Stopped working last night - plastic body deformed (likely due to extreme heat),"Rooba has been an unpleasant adventure for us.For the first month it couldn't navigate past dining table/chairs area on most nights. We made it a habit to put the chairs up on the table every night (like in restaurants) to aid the poor soul. It is hard work but it helped - it started to reliably navigated past the dining space. Then, it couldn't navigate the rug in the powder room under the washbasin :(. We started shutting the powder room door every night. Result! - it could then reliably navigate to the living room/drawing room area.We had a few weeks of good cleaning (pet hair and all) - yes it's really nice when it works.But this morning I found it dead in the kitchen - no response when I guided it to the base station (no charging lights). Then to my horror - I realized that a portion of the top plastic body had buckled in (yep!) - likely due to extreme heat. I'm glad it didn't cause a fire at 2am, but also sad that it went kaput just as I'd started to like it a little (I design software for a living - it's in my DNA to fall in love with autonomous machines trying so hard to be helpful, whereas all my lawyer wife can say is #*%!*)Now starts the fun process of calling the company and bickering about warrenty/repair/replacement. I'll let you know how that goes."

1/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Roomba 650 Vacuum Falls Apart In 40 Days...,"Received this on 12-09-2014 - today is 01-18-2015.  I have one dog (Lab) and two long-hair house cats.  Obviously, I need help with the fur shedding issue.  I purchased this unit as a maintenance tool (in between Dyson Deep-clean vacuuming).  According to the description, this model is made to pick up animal fur.  It can be programmed and the wearable and replaceable parts are fairly inexpensive.  I programmed this unit to run everyday.  I clean the unit after each cleaning cycle - taking the brushes apart and removing fur buildup on any moving parts.  As of today, the top small circular cover is broken off - caught on the kick-plate area of our lower kitchen cupboards.  This happened the first day it was in use.  It will no longer hold the programming that was initially done. I have to manually start it each day - it has never completely lost power and has always gone back to it's dock when a cycle is complete.  After a little more than a month's daily use, it is half broken, the corner brushes are scratching my floorboards and it no longer completely vacuums the area it used to clean.  I am definitely not impressed with this appliance - especially for the price point paid ($349.99).  This is the same price I paid for my Dyson upright and although I have to manually push this appliance, at least it does what was promised.  I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS MACHINE."

First few days I was hoping it will get better as soon as it figures out the house layout but...It spent hours riding around and randomly cleaning the house here and there or could just clean a couple of sq feet and back to the station.

11/07/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,IROBOT ROOMBA 650,"Really happy with the product. I have back problems so putting on the Roomba a little everyday certainly helps. I also nanny for a living and have kids of my own so it's good to know the Roomba can help pick up crumbs and dirt while I take care of other chores. If you do have back problems, I recommend getting the remote as well."
1/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,really great works great
12/29/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Great idea but...,Really great idea but if you have dark floors or dark carpets the thing is completely useless and impossible to return once it's opened.
4/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,real nice love it
6/23/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Good quality,"Quite happy with this unit so far. I read through some reviews online and was almost ready to buy a less recognized branded product, but came back to Roomba as the final decision. I have a 1 bedroom apartment with hard floors so it's compatible to my home environment. Not the panacea of dirt on the floor/rug but is a nice supplement to my other cleaning. Pretty impressed since I'd never owned a robotic vacuum before now."
03/04/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,How did we live without it,"Push a button and it cleans the floor, what more could you ask.  Well, how about one that dusts the furniture?  When iRobot makes it I will be first in line to buy it."
01/03/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,Purchased the roomba for my wife for christmas. She loves it. Mission accomplished!
01/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,Purchased for my daughter...has two house dogs.  Wonderful
12/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It looks great and I truly hope it works as,Purchased as Christmas gift so I can not comment on performance. It looks great and I truly hope it works as advertised
12/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Life Saver / Game Changer,"Purchased about a month ago and this has CHANGED MY LIFE. I have two dogs, and this keeps the hair under control during the week. ""Rosie"" as I have named my Roomba is scheduled to clean daily in the afternoon. She has attempted to eat a sneaker and shut herself in the bathroom once or twice, but nothing that would discourage me from using her. Roomba likes not too much clutter, and this inspires me to keep my home tidy. I live on in a 1 story single family home with tile, hardwood, and some area rugs. MY only regret is not buying this 8 year ago when I got my dog!"
01/03/2016,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,I fell in love with it the first few weeks after buying it,"Pros:I fell in love with it the first few weeks after buying it... It did a great job of going under the beds, in closets, tables, stereo cabinet, etc... wherever it could fit... I began organizing the house so it would be able to reach more areas... I love that it goes over the thresholds, mats and rugs on my hardwood and tile floors... some are pretty high... I was impressed by this... I have to young boys so cleaning the floor constantly is a chore...Cons:Got it for Christmas so I was eager to try it out on a hard job...  I took the Christmas tree down and left the spruce needles on the hardwood floor... While it picked up some, it left a lot more than it picked up...  giving it the benefit of the doubt (heavy job and all) I helped it out by sweeping up some... I notice it goes over the same areas several times and completely misses other areas... When I leave it to roam the entire house, I find it stays in one area a lot more than others... I'll periodically move it to other areas so it can cover them.  It doesn't do so well in the corners so I will sweep them when its running...Overall 3.5 Stars... while it does a good job it doesn't do a great job...  my suggestion for improvement:  needs a stronger suction on it..."
12/19/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Really surprised,"Pros:Gets under beds, couches and places that upright will not get easily.You just hit the button and go do something else.  Or schedule it and are already doing something elseReduces the need for upright.  Though I could see me needing to break it out once a month and for stairs.Gets all the dog hair and that alone is worth its weight in gold.Easy to clean.  4 minutes tops.  Slower at first.  You'll get the hang of it. I use canned air to blow out the filter to extend its life.  Do that outside.Cons:Expect to clean it a lot at first.  It will go to places your vacuum hasn't seen and find some gross things.  Do you have dogs and when was the last time you looked under your bed?Little loud, Sounds like a loud pencil sharpener to me.  Not terrible but I wouldn't have a business call in the same room.  next room no problemPerceived randomness.  It will get everything but if you watch it work you'll really wonder. Just walk away and come backYou will need to roomba proof when you find it stuck here and there.  There will be furniture that will hang it up.Depending on your layout, May not always find way back to dock. Just experiment with placementOverall: Great device and picks up everything an upright would. I haven't tried the scheduling so I cannot comment on that. Id love another for the upstairs floor but at 400 bones it will be a while"
5/30/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Couldn't Handle Small Apartment,"Pros:- Does a good job cleaning (sometimes it ignores areas)- Found the home base more often then not (unless it got stuck)Cons:- Doesn't clean black carpet.  I knew this was a known problem when I purchased it and was able to cover the sensors like other have suggested.  But this only worked temporarily.- Got beat up pretty quickly. Scratches and marks started to show up only after a couple cleanings.- It's cleaning method is flawed. It appears to be just bouncing off walls.  Sometimes it cleaned all the areas I wanted other times it  would miss completely.-  It get's stuck on things a little to easily. To prevent it from getting stuck, I started to use random shoes to block it from getting stuck in certain areas.To sum it up, when it worked, it worked very well.  I wanted this mainly to clean hard to reach places like under my bed and my carpet. At the end of the day it ended up being more work helping the robot then just cleaning myself.  Showed promise but ended up returning it.  I have a small place.  I have no idea how this would handle a house with multiple rooms.If you want this to work on black carpets, don't waste your time. Roomba's have a sensor that detect when it senses stairs so it doesn't fall down.  The problem with this is when it see's black carpet it thinks it going to fall.  Until iRobot has a way to turn off that sensor, the entire iRobot product line is useless to black carpet users."
01/07/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Good purchase, albeit a bit pricey. Beat vacuum the whole house daily.","Pros: easy automatic effectiveCons: each run takes almost 1.5 hours, need to clean roomba after each use""It works as advertised. We were a bit skeptical at first since we have lots of furniture and three cats and a dog.First time we ran it, it took almost an hour and half to vacuum the whole house. It vacuumed the same place three to four times. I guess the Roomba isn't smart enough.Anyway, it managed to return to docking station. When we cleaned it, we were surprised to see how much dust it collected.We run the Roomba daily. Just make sure you clean the Roomba after each use. I don't mind cleaning the Roomba. It beats cleaning the whole house."""
3/25/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great for Bunnies - Cliff Detection Lacking,"Pros: - This Roomba is great for cleaning up after bunnies. It gets any poops that don't make it into the litter box, and it even picks up the hay. The bunnies don't love the Roomba, but they tolerate it. - I love the scheduling feature. We have it set to clean every weekday at 4:30, so the house is clean when we get home. You can set different times for different days of the week. - A pleasant woman's voice actually tells you what's wrong instead of just displaying an error code or beeping. The female voice is a little confusing, since we named him Mr. Roomba, but we accept him/her for who he/she is. - The bin has a decent capacity and is easy to empty. - I'm impressed with the battery life. - If you press the docking button it'll make its way back to the charging base, as long as it's within a few feet of it.Cons - It has cliff detection, which means it doesn't fall down the stairs, but when it sees the stairs it just stops and asks you to rescue it. I wish it would back away from the stairs and continue cleaning. - We have a bar stool like this (http://smile.amazon.com/Winsome-Wood-Spectrum-Swivel-Adjustable/dp/B0046EC162), and the Roomba always gets stuck on the base. We end up keeping the bar stool shut away in the bathroom so the Roomba won't get stuck.Overall it's definitely worth the money."
04/12/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Wonderful for multi-pet owners,"Pros - Life altering purchase if you a frequent cleaner. I'd give it a 4.5 but that's not an option so I'll round up. I have 2 great danes that shed during the hot summer months in the south. I went from vacuuming or sweeping at least every other day to only having to do it about every 10 days. I've nicknamed him Ralphie and he works his rear end off. I have a very unique shape floorplan and Ralphie has learned it with no problems. I have a 3200 sq ft home and he can do the entire downstairs only having to be emptied after he's done. Ralphie does well on rugs, hardwood, and tile; I have no carpet so can not speak to it.Cons - They will get stuck under certain sizes of furniture but not often. Also, every 3rd use you need to clean the brush and rollers but this is not hard to do. I highly recommend you get a model that has more of the virtual walls with it as it will do a far superior job cleaning if you quadrant off certain rooms to only do those at a time. Also, they will catch cables that are under a couch so you have to tuck those in."
3/16/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Impressive gizmo, finds dirt I cannot see","PROIt finds dirt I cannot see. No matter how often I run it in a place I think is clean, it finds more.It starts on schedule, cleans my living room, dining room, and kitchen -- and parks itself again. It can go days without any attention at all.It's happy on floors, rugs, combinations, carpet, under furniture.It won't throw itself down stairs.Quick to unpack, charge and put to use.Easy to schedule.Results visible immediately.CONBumps into things it should really be able to 'see'. The sensor array needs improvement. It detects walls if headed mostly toward them and slows before impact, but mostly it bumps gently and reacts. Determining the edges of things consists mostly of turning and bumping. A higher resolution view of the world would allow much better routing and impact decisions.I have a golden retriever. Roomba gets all of it, but it tends to get wound around every spinning part. The brush, the beater, the third wheel, and the side brush all build fuzzy donuts of finely spun dog hair. The side brush only made it two days before it jammed. It was easy to fix, but it happened fast. After four days the brush needed serious hair removal.PERSONAL NOTESFirst night it ran sixty minutes and called for help. Turns out a wheel was jammed with lots of ribbon it found somewhere. It hasn't had a problem since.I wish it didn't require as much maintenance, but that is really because of the dog.This device would have been absolutely ideal for all of my apartments; have it run while you are at work, and you just don't need to vacuum -- that would have been incredible when I was single."
12/20/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great investment,Product works better then expected it runs around the whole house for around an hour. I was amazed at how much dirt and pet hair it picks up every time is cleans the bin is full. so far so good if it lasts at least 2 years I'll buy another one for sure.
8/23/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,Product arrived in a timely manner and works fantastic! I love it!
8/17/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Not Perfect but Practical,"Problem: 2500 sq. feet hardwood floor + some low rug. Add 2 shedding indoor/outdoor dogs, kids, tracked in dirt.Solution: 4 Roombas run every other day. Clean Roombas once a week - takes 15-20 minutes to clean all of them.  (Use a shop vac to clean them up and out + added picks and brushes that come with the Roomba).Bottom Line: Are their drawbacks and problems; yes. BUT, it's infinitely better than vacuuming the place every couple of days. If I knew of a better solution I'd take it, but short of having live in help it's the best solution we've yet found. Know of a better way? Please let us know.Some Details:  Oldest Roomba is more than 4 years old and still cleans well though it's lost the ability to charge from the docking port.  The newer units are improved in that it is easier to clean out the long dog hair that inevitably gets wound around the inside parts.Cleaning is the worst part of these things. My tolerance limit is cleaning them once a week which is why we have 4 of them.  Cleaning several at one time is pretty easy - the key is to use a shop vac.  If you don't like getting your hands dirty or have the patience for taking little parts out and scraping off the fused dog hair, then this is not the solution for you."
6/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Price jumped $60.00 overnight.,Price jumped $60.00 overnight.  Reconsidering this purchase. I doubt if it was improved overnight.
04/06/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great Vacuum!,"Positives: This thing is a great Vacuum! Equally awesome on carpet and wood floors. It is so easy to program cleaning times. The floors look great!Negatives: It is not maintenance free! Also, You also have to pick up cloth, string and wire up or they will get sucked up and the Roomba will stop.It is also a pesky and determined little guy...it will push doors open and get in rooms you don't want it to if the doors aren't firmly secure.We have rooms that are separated by a floor molding that the roomba can't get over....so I have to plan what area of the house I want it in that night. It has also fallen over the edge of our kitchen/family room once or twice. There is like an 8 inch level difference. We have found it turned upside down on the lower level.  That's annoying but our fault. If you use the virtual wall...it's not a problem. It normally works, well...normally.The last negative is that it sometimes has a hard time backing up into it's dock. The dock is really light and the roomba can push it around instead of docking. When you first get it, it seems like it is cleaning in the most random patterns and that the brush is just throwing cheerios around...but when it's done...the floors look great.Conclusion: I just get annoyed when I see people complain about the roomba being a lot of work...because it does such a thorough job and all you have to do is move a chair or pick up your socks. There is some prep work involved but it is worth it. It picks up loose change...but does have a hard time with like beads or things bigger objects. So you have to pick up obvious things. When it is done with a room it looks super clean...so much better than if you did it yourself with an oreck.We Love it so much we are going to try a scooba."

12/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Insane, Just INSANE!","Picked this up at Target, I went back & forth for a bit as I had to reconcile it was ok to be lazy enough to spend this much on a robot vacuum when I have a regular one and a broom! Well after a week, I gotta say I don't regret the buy. Not only does it do an awesome job but I find myself confused by how much it picks up every day.I have a dog (westie) and two cats (one with long hair) and you wouldn't know it by looking at my floors. The only ""negative"" I would offer is that it's kind of loud. so it's best to let it run while you're not home. Otherwise it's a 100% GO FOR IT1"
9/30/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I am Disabled ---And I No Longer Need To Hire Housecleaners....iRobot is Life Changing,"Physically Disabled And Cannot Use A Vacuum - This Product is cleaning heaven.  I have wood floors, wool area rugs and a large Golden Retriever Service Dog....nothing is harder to clean than dog hair on wool  and hair balls that accumulate along the sides and corners of wood floors.  Also his long hair is like velcro for dead leaves, sticks and other debris that gets tracked in and spread around daily.....my floors have never been so clean and I THAT IS A GOOD FEELING when you can't do much cleaning yourself.I was concerned about the dog hair.  The only vacuum that worked was a Very Expensive Miele that does a but have to have someone do it for me and that would only happen a few times/month.  Now I have clean floors EVERY DAY.  Someone still does the furniture and other hard to reach places but with so little dirt and dog hair on the floor, little finds it's way into other places.Definitely makes my life easier as I have always been a stickler for clean floors and this machine picks of pet hair and even the finest dirt and dust.  Emptying the collection container is a cinch and cleaning the brushes takes less than two minutes.My favorite household item and the one that has made the biggest difference ....it's almost as good as having hiring housecleaners."

3/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Perfect. Just what I wanted,Perfect.  Just what I wanted.  Does a great job.  Sometimes get stuck under my couch. But not every time.  Good on carpet and in kitchen on vinyl. Great on pet hair

I wasn't convinced that spending this much $$ for a vacuum was worth it until I watched my sisters Roomba knock out 4 rooms until they shined.  And she has a dog!  We do not, but I can no longer tote around a heavy vacuum cleaner.  This is a wonderful solution.  It traverses my hard wood floors, rugs with ease.  I ordered the maintenance kit upfront - I know this little baby will get lots of use.  I have scheduled it every other day as it cleans so well it doesn't need a daily run.  I would highly recommend this product - it's a life saver!!!!!!!!"

02/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,It does a good job but requires a lot of maintenance.,"Overall it's a vacuum, it doesn't what it's supposed to do. It fits under things our normal vacuum don't. This saves us the effort of moving heavy furniture to clean under it. We've been amazed at how much it does pick up. However, even with the pet model like this expect your pet hair to do a real number on the unit. This has been running for 3 months now, we set it up to clean one floor of our house almost every day, so I'd say it runs 5 days a week, on a house that's about 900 square feet per floor. We have a dog with long hair, so it gets wrapped around both brushes, and it does damage them. We clean the Roomba thoroughly every time it's run, which takes about 5-10 minutes or so each time, but even with constant attention the rubber brush needs to be replaced after three months and the other brush isn't looking that good.Pros:We spend less time cleaning, 5-10 minutes a day at the most.It does a better job and gets into the places we normally can't.Cons:It does still require you to clean the Roomba every time you use it.The parts wear out and will need to be replaced often."
8/28/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Saves time, increases productivity and reduces frustrations!","Over a year of research and price comparisons, doubt and hesitations. What a waste of time! Darn thing is fantastic. Not nearly as noisy as I expected and in fact quieter than a regular vacuum. Emptying the bin after every use is not a big deal. weekly cleaning of the rollers etc. is really a non issue too. Spare parts for the potential  wear items appear reasonable enough on line although we have not yet purchased spares. We will, just to have them handy so we do not ever have to wait to keep it going. Three very large dogs are in the house about 40 percent of the day. Every morning I push start and go to work. Every evening I come home to a clean floor. Rarely has ""Heidi"" got hung up and when it does happen it is no big deal at all. The time saved has been worth every penny and the novelty has been entertaining. Used primarily on  porcelain tile with a couple heavy throw rugs, 700sq foot room with stairs and a drop off, lots of turns and furniture in odd places. She gets the job done. I have placed her in other carpeted rooms and also been amazed at the great job, but she lives in the main room. Don't watch if you are a linear personality, as her random patterns will drive you nuts. Just go do something else and come back to a cleaner floor. I do not worry about a visitor right after work seeing a drifting hair pile, and a bit of sand or gravel on a guests shoes doesn't make me nearly as upset, LOL."

04/10/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Her name is Hazel,"Our Roomba is a big hit in my house. My husband named her Hazel, she is set to clean every day at 10am. Every night I empty her bin and am surprised to see how much has been picked up. I still need a regular vacuum for the corners and hard to reach spots, but if you can accept that Roomba is just going to keep the house looking good between cleanings you will be happy. Great for families with pets, and active lives. I have two dogs and do not get to the vacuuming as often as I would like to, good to know that Hazel has got my back"
05/06/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Does the job,"Our roomba 650 has done a great job cleaning our ~500 square foot first floor that has a mix of hardwood and rug floors. It's only occasionally gotten stranded, usually because it drained its battery fighting a cord it picked up. It's extremely easy to maintain, and does a great job on routine ""maintenance"" cleaning. The way it bumps around is charming, and it's not very noisy, about a loud electric box fan at max. Probably too loud for a quiet, sleeping house, but easily ignorable if you're awake and busy.Pets have quickly learned to ignore it, even my chicken scaredy-cat dog that's afraid of everything."
01/03/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Far exceeded my expectations,"Our Rooma's name is Rosie, based on the robot maid from ""The Jetsons"". And while she isn't serving us drinks (yet), Rosie does an amazing job cleaning the floor.This roomba's vacuum is amazing. Easily the equal of any full size vacuum we've used. Rosie cleans carpet, tile, and rugs with ease. We've stopped finding random cat hair around the house, even though our older cat seems to be desperately pulling out entire tufts of fur in an effort to go bald.More importantly is how effortless the entire thing is. We set a schedule (every day at noon) and she starts cleaning, goes through the entire house and then returns to her docking station autonomously. There's no 'making sure the roomba is charged' or having to find it after it finishes cleaning.I was skeptical about roombas for years. I thought they were a cool gimmick, but not really worth the money. Now I wish I'd bought one sooner."
3/31/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Gerty is A Workhorse,"Our new Roomba 650 is awesome. Her name is Gerty (think the movie Moon), and she has already had two runs. The only issue we noticed is that she had a hard time docking the first time when we placed the dock under a piece of furniture. She ran twice the first day for about 2 hours before finding her dock. Covered a 1400 SF downstairs without a hitch. Had to clean the bin and the brushes each time, but that took a LOT less time than vacuuming the downstairs twice. Now if we could just teach her to climb the stairs or groom our clothes of cat hair (we have 4 cats indoors)!"
1/31/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Wish we had purchased one sooner.,"Our little dog sheds and everyday we run ""Ethel"" our Roomba and are surprised every time we find the tray full of dog hair and fine lint.  She glides across our tile floors and carpeted bedrooms with ease.  We absolutely love this little machine and we're glad our daughter recommended it to us.  We're senior citizens and it has made our lives so much easier and the floors look so much cleaner and free of pet hair and dust."
3/28/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Did not perform as expected,"Our house is a small ranch, but the Roomba had many problems in it. It got stuck behind our toilet, trapped itself in our bedroom and thought the dark spots on our multicolored area rug were cliffs that it had to avoid. We were considering getting a new area rug if the Roomba had performed well enough otherwise. But it did not. It couldn't even find it's dock effectively if its battery was getting low. The problem with finding the dock is that it's on a light sensor. My husband said that if it were a radio frequency it could come back from anywhere. But the way it is means that it has to just keep sweeping until it happens to pass close enough to the dock to see it's light. Maybe some of these glitches are worked out in the more advanced models. And maybe for the price it's ok if you have a very open floor plan so it can't get stuck on things. But we were not satisfied. It was more work to worry about whether Roomba was going to do ok while we were gone than it would have been to just sweep the floor myself."

I was concerned that our dark blue carpet would cause problems, but to no avail! Rosie cleans her way through our house doing all the carpets, tile, and over the rugs, I like how she navigates under the furniture and beds. I use one virtual wall to keep her from trying to clean under a large bookcase where she got stuck the first day on the job, but have had no other problems. I did order 2 other virtual walls to use near our Christmas tree. We will go out shopping or to dinner and leave Rosie to clean while we're away, when we return, our house is vacuumed and Rosie is back at her docking station relaxing and getting all charged up for the next day, life is great"

9/30/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Make sure your dog doesn't poop in the house while Roomba is cleaning!!,"Only had mine for a couple days when it was running while I wasn't home, and my dog took a dump on the rug...Roomba spread it all over the area.  WHAT A DISASTER!  My dog rarely has an accident.  I had enough time to see that Roomba works really well, so am ordering a replacement."
08/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,One of the best tools for saving time,"One of the best tools for saving time. I leave it working when I leave for work and when I get back my floor looks like new, it takes 2 minutes to clean and its good to go again."
04/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,One of the best purchases we have made in a long time. Every home needs one of these.
11/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Awesome,One of the best purchases my wife and I have ever made. Keeps the house free of dust and so easy to just set up and leave. There are a few problem spots it gets stuck but we just use the virtual walls to keep it out of there. All around great product though. Does a great job.
4/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,One of my favorite purchases ever,"One of my favorite purchases ever. I have a dog that sheds a fair amount and this Roomba keeps my apartment fur free. It cleans in places and under things that I would never actually get to myself. For the cost of a few visits of a house cleaner, it's well worth it."
11/13/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Optimize your house for Roomba and let the cleaning begin,"Once you have figured you have to ""optimize"" your home for Roomba it does its job very well.  This means no loose cords on the floor, move some things a bit so it has the space to travel where you want it to clean.  After that, program it for the weekdays and watch it clean the house.  You have to remember to clean the dust bucket every day at first but gradually the house will get cleaner and it won't matter so much. Also remove hairs from the brushes with the special tool the first few days of cleaning after that a weekly cleanup will be fine.  Consider also cleaning the dust filter with compressed air once a week (push the air from the ""clean"" side of the filter, do it outside the house as a lot of dust gets trapped there).Once you understand you have to take care of the Roomba a bit (mostly in the beginning) then you will enjoy it.I gave it four star because it seems on some surfaces it will have problems: mostly long hair rugs which it might ""avoid"", plus we get the ""error 6"" and it stops cleaning on a black carpet when there is too much dust on the infrared sensors, it thinks it's about to fall from the carpet, go figure.  It's a great robot vacuum, not perfect but it does a good job.One last thing to note, having the charging base station in a ""central"" location of the house will make it easier for it to return there once the cleaning is done."
9/18/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,Three Stars,Once it fell off to the stair. Cleaning is a little bit troublesome.
11/20/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I love my Roomba! Week one.,"OMG, I have only had this device for a week and I am lovin' it! Amazing how much stuff it picks up. Who cares about the Hepa filter- the amount of hair and dust it gathers is unbelievable. I had to Roomba proof the house (cords up, pet bowls protected) and had a few accidents with plastic bags and such, but otherwise things are going well. The only thing I haven't figured out is how to keep it calm while I am tipping it upside down to clean out the brushes. It verbally spew error messages when I expose its belly. But so does the cat."
12/27/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,works amazing. was worried it would knock over things,"omg!!! regret not buying this sooner!! works amazing. was worried it would knock over things, nope, it backs it self off even on the most delicate omg that's gonna fall over things, i was worried that my loose string and mess it up so i left my shoes out just to see, and nope after like 3 secs it spits it back out and moves on.  This was brilliantly designed and produced!!! Picks up waaaaaayyyyyyy  waaaayyyyy ,, ( pant) waaaayyyy more dirt , lint , etc then my old vacuum. !"
12/08/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This is the best thing we've purchased in a long time,"OMG! This is the best thing we've purchased in a long time. We live in a very, very, very, very tiny studio apartment that needs to be kept tidy all the time. It's great to have a vacuum run once a day or more on our hardwood floors. It's able to pick all the dirt and hair up that accumulates in our tiny space. We have two rugs as well and it cleans them without a problem. Worth every cent! I never have to vacuum again.The vacuum makes many random passes, but it definitely gets the job done.Con: make sure small cords like headphones etc, and small clothing items are picked up or they might get caught."
09/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I thought I was a good housecleaning person in my house,"OMG! I thought I was a good housecleaning person in my house! This device really cleans well! I am Loving the hours of manual labor it saves me each month! For the device to work well, you must declutter your home and move electrical wires to a safe position. I like that problem since it makes me feel more organized. The first week, I was shocked how much debris it picked up! What a fantastic cleaning machine!"
6/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,BEST PURCHASE EVER,OMG! I can literally walk away And it  clean the whole house it'll go for hours and even go back to its docking station to recharge itself absolutely love this. The only issue I see is everything has to be picked up out of the floor first. We have had this for months now
11/16/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Omg the greatest gift ever my wife loves it really helps with ...,Omg the greatest gift ever my wife loves it really helps with the pet hair and I have dark floors carpet tile no problems at all get one they are fantastic
01/03/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,"Starts off well, but didn't last a week","Ok, so we have a lot of wood floors and a yellow lab. Plenty of hair to pick up. First couple of days it seemed to do well, but maybe that was because it removed a majority of the hair. But as we set it about the rooms, we noticed that it wasn't really picking up that final 15%. We cleaned the bin, the brushes, talked with customer support, etc. It passes right over the hair multiple times. ""Rosie"" says she is done, we go in, bin hardly any hair/dirt in it, but we can still see the blond hairs on the wood floors. Shouldn't be that way. Customer service offered no help other than to return it to where it was purchased."
01/04/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Yay, it works !","Ok, so I'm a bit tentative because I'm purchasing this as a gift for someone who is a cleaning wiz and had my doubts as to how well this little guy would perform. However, once charged, the Roomba did an incredible job of getting up unseen dirt from the carpet and left the hardwood floors looking spotless.  As has been recommended, cleaning the little guy out after each use insures that it will operate at its best.  Good one Roomba !"
9/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It has changed my life,"Ok, so I have the 655 model from Costco. Not sure exactly what the big difference is but it has an extra 5- maybe just to make Costco members feel special? Who knows. I was a early adopter of the Roomba first series. I hated it, it was crap. It was loud and basically crappy. I stopped using it after a couple months and eventually we sold it.Fast forward to now. I saw this new model at Costco hopped on Amazon to price compare and read reviews. The reviews were surprisingly good. Costco had a rebate at the time so the price was better to buy there. I bought it for myself for my birthday. It's a gift. I have two active kids that drag dirt and leaves from the outdoors and two cats. This vacuum has changed my life. I want another one. I have a 3400 sqft house and while it doesn't cover it well it does a great job. My floors have never been so clean. I am no longer resentful that crap is being tracked all over the house by 3 other humans and two cats. I vacuumed almost everyday which took up a lot of time. Now I have time to do other things to maintain the house, like mop, clean the bathrooms, etc."
6/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Best purchase I have made in decades,"OK, I have pet parrots, and they make cat mess look like a picnic!  This baby cleans the floor so very well, I absolutely LOVE it!!!!  It is so darn  smart that it can go over power cords, and know to leave them alone, but it is not put off by them either....it goes over cords gently, and vacuums BENEATH THEM!!  I can't say enough good about this.  It is the single best thing I have bought in decades.  I think it is worth even more than I paid for it, as it has zero problems.  (I have replaced my regular vacuum 3 times in 2 years, including a Dyson).  WOW!"
3/15/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,wow !,"ok, i don't ever write reviews.  which is hypocritical since i rely on amazon reviews even when i'm shopping in stores !!but, this thing is awesome.  i also have a Dyson vacuum at the house.  i have all tile floors thru out the house now.  i have 2 shar pei's and a longish haired cat.  i bought this model over the 630 cause you can program this one to vacuum the house while you're at work.  with 3 pets the hair can get out of hand and needs to be swept/vacuumed up at least every 2 days or so....and let's be honest.  most people work jobs all day you don't want to come home and vacuum the whole house every other day !  i'm amazed at the amount of debris, dust, and hair this thing has in it's bin every night when i come home and empty out the compartment.  it's usually sitting on it's dock recharging when i come home.  there's been a couple of times it's gotten hung up on a rug or power cord.....but after you remove the items it gets caught up on....no issues what so ever.this is a must have for any pet owner !!  i have it programmed to ""work"" mon-fri at 3pm.  so i never have to hear it working....just come home to a spotless house !!!  awesome !!!"
10/17/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Cute Cute Cute!,"OK, I confess I choose this model simply because it is the cutest design among all the models. It works pretty well, but since that's the only vacumme cleaner I own so I don't really get the chance to compare it to others. Anyway, we could all use a little bit whim in our life-----i.e., buy a vacuum cleaner simply because it is cute(OK, I confess my dog does not agree with me on this point)."
11/19/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Really good...most of the time.,"Ok, I admit I was a skeptic but decided to give it a try as I simply dread pulling out the canister vac. Roomba really does a fantastic job of getting into places where no broom dares to go, and through multiple goings-over under my cabinets are as clean as the rest of my floor. There we a couple of snags though.  Often it will go right over a chunk of something and leave it behind, only sometimes getting it on the second go round. The sound doesn't seem to bother some folks but I found it can get noisy (perhaps louder because we have hardwood?). Sure, you can run it when you are out of the house, and it then becomes a daily game of find the roomba, as it is rarely docked and recharging when we get home. It has been stuck under two chairs, the dresser after eating an errant tissue and often pushes its own docking station into a position so it can't dock and charge. Lastly, this is not a fantastic item if you live in a cramped home as the roomba needs a docking space that is clear and unobstructed, both for the vacuum to receive the signal indicating where the docking station is and then to be able to get to it. Problems aside, seeing the amount of dust and dirt it collects on a daily basis, I know that my house is cleaner after it runs, and I am finally able to get my 4 year old to clean up his Legos with the promise that the Roomba will gobble up whatever is left on the floor. If on the fence as to whether to invest, ask yourself this: which do you like least - messing with the Roomba or vacuuming?"
7/18/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Impressed,"OK,  When the wife said she wanted this I thought she was crazy.  This cant work, like most other gadgets.  But it does.  I am always amazed when it goes out and vacuums and then finds its way back home!  It does a good job of keeping the pet hair under control between bigger cleanings.  You do have to empty the rather small bin but overall impressed."
11/01/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Robotic Fur Fighter,"Ok lets start out with this. I have had seven roombas over many years . Some have passed on, some were retired, some ran off (I think kids were involved).From the simple red ones to the more advanced 560, the scooba, and now the 650. One thing you can count on with irobot is the higher the model number the higher the price and yes features. I feel there comes a point when the features get in the way of the product and we may be approaching that timeline.The red simple models are great. Do they pickup everything, no. Are they pretty reliable, yes. I have one that is five or six years old and all I have done is replace the battery. One other red one just went insane and died after two years.The scooba... well that was just a mess. It tried hard but could tell even when new it was just waiting to freak out and break down. Gave it away couldnt face the future loss as you do tend to get attached to them slinking around the house.The 560 was a complete dog. It started having nervous issues after only two months then the battery went. Replaced battery then all the warning issues. This one talks to you so she was always telling me her problems and what she needed and what she cant do. Im guessing just like a real maid that is high strung and bad temperament. Dead with the fatal error code 3 AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! Well that was three hundred bucks I will never see again. (insert sound of toilet flush). This is where I will recommend the square trade extended warranty. I never got it but should have.So it looks like all the new models die just after the warranty is up by a few days. So now I have three dead ones the others were trashed. The quality does not seem to be improving as fast as the complications. The more advanced the higher the chance of failure.The 650 is a little heavier than the 560 that I have (may she rest in peace). Everything about it otherwise seems just the same. It has better hair pickup and a few more bells and whistles but it should for four hundred dollars. With the reliability track record I dont think i would spend he dinero on this one. Find it on sale if you must. Just not comfortable with the longevity any more and customer service at irobot while friendly is not much help. There are lots of forums that will help you trouble shoot your issues. Maybe too many.650 so far its working as intended. We shall see. Old red and 560 sitting in garage awaiting burial.In the end I think irobot should FOCUS on making them better vacuums and less on new features and gimmicks. They could do it if they want to, and make them less complicated so they will last longer. As always if you have any questions just ask me.Update April 2013: 650 and old red still going strong."
10/29/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,For sure better than my old 530!!,"Ok I have been using robotic vacuums for about 7 years now starting with the old Roomba 400 and moving up to a Roomba 510, then a 530, and a 560. I also currently own an Neato XV11. I was really excited to receive this new Roomba 650 pet series because I have had problem with dog and people hair getting wrapped around the roller brushes on all my Roomba's and even the Neato XV11 would get some on it from time to time. I have been very pleased that after a week and half of heavy use not one bit of hair on rollers! I also noticed that this one picks up a lot more that my current Roomba 530. My Neato always picks up a lot but does not do edges anywhere as good as the Roomba so thus I have both a Neato and a Roomba. I have noticed that the run time on this new Roomba 650 is over 2.5 hrs and cleans very well. The new Roomba is also faster than the 530 and Neato. As for noise it is about the same as my old 530 and is much quieter than the Neato. The scheduling feature is also nice and handy but I do not really use it because I work from home so don't have much need for it but I always say it is better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. A couple of things I have noticed that are upgrades is the brush head that the older ones had some problems with looks to be upgraded and also has the Areovac and that is a big improvement for suction. Overall I have been pretty impressed but still is not a smart vacuum cleaner like the Neato and that is why the 4 stars. Yes I would recommend this to purchase. Thanks"

08/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"It's pricy, but I promise you won't regret it.","Oh Roomba...  How I love you.  I don't know what we did before this!  (We had dirty floors, I suppose...)Roomba is great at picking up dog and cat fur.  Sometimes he misses some things, but if you throw him back in the room and ask him to go over it again, he always picks it up.  You do have to be diligent about emptying his tray and cleaning him out (which I'm not the best at), but it's really not much effort.  He's such a time-saver and I can spend the time that I used to spend vacuuming actually doing other things.Expensive, but worth it."
12/06/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,best investment ever - I love this thing,"oh my goodness, best investment ever - I love this thing!! and my dog is adjusting to it and my grandson thinks it is the best ever!!  too cute"
12/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,I hate having to clean the bin constantly and unravel hair ...,"Nothing's wrong with it. I guess I have buyer's remorse for spending so much on an item that has limited capabilities. It does not function on high-pile rug AT ALL! just gets stuck and goes in circles. That's a bummer. I find I have to continuously pick it up and move it to where I want it to go since it doesn't travel over my high-pile rugs. I could have bought 3 high functioning vacuums for the cost of this one Roomba, and instead I have one low-functioning robot-pet-vacuum. I hate having to clean the bin constantly and unravel hair caught in the brush. It's too high-maintenance for me. Prefer a big strong vacuum that does the job manually once a week with control and efficiency."
11/29/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Not Worth the Trouble!,"Not worth the money.  I bought this for my daughter to help her with household cleaning, so she could clean floors as she slept. It worked for a few months ( not good on carperts only hardwood or tile).  Then I ordered a replacement upgraded cleaning compartment, which only worked for a couple of cleanings.  It continues to stop after a few minutes saying to clean roller compartment when I just did.It is great for pushing our things that are under the sofa or beds, but that is it.  Much easier to sweep the floors yourself!  Jo"
1/17/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,doesn't pick up cat hair,Not to happy with this as it doesn't pick up the cat hair which it told me it would.  It's okay
7/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,Not the best robot vacuum I've ever had,"Not the best robot vacuum I've ever had. It gets suck on things frequently, yet won't go over my rugs that are on my hardwood. I had a Neato before the Roomba and I think it did a better job, it was cheaper too!"
9/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,I would recommend a more advanced unit at this point,"Not sure it's worth the price, but it does what it's supposed to in an average fashion.  I would recommend a more advanced unit at this point."
09/12/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,"Not perfect, but definitely worth every penny.","Not perfect, but definitely worth every penny.  Our Roomba is scheduled to clean every day of the week.  We constrain it to one room at a time, letting it clean one area per day.  I would say its success rate at returning to the base charge station after a clean is about 60%.Our Roomba will get stuck on seemingly silly things.  For example our Roomba seems to think that the height difference between our high pile carpet and the floor vents qualifies as a high cliff that it must avoid at all costs.  This leads to our little friend often panicking when it hits a floor vent and then stopping with an error.Other things that often cause issues for our Roomba are wires (the advertised anti-tangle feature not so great in practice) and the rogue flip-flop or sandal.But these are all acceptable issues when contrasted against the fact that this little robot vacuums a room in our home daily.The bottom line is this Roomba is worth the money.  However, I am excited to see the product line continue to improve and evolve."
3/15/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,best purchase I have ever made,Not kidding.  I never realized how much dust accumulates until I gut this little guy.  I have a 700 sqft apartment and roomba cleans it one time a day for an hour every day.  Every day it fills up its dust tray (about the size of 2 fists).  EVERY DAY! thats a ton!This one picks up dog hair like a champ and handles carpet and hard wood well.  It never gets stuck unless it sucks of something I left on the floor.One must have for roomba is this little circular comb that pulls all the hair off the rollers which I do once or twice a month.  There is a link to it at the bottom.  And just wash the hepa filter.  There is no point to buying new ones all the time.  Have one extra so you can put it in while the other dryes.Its a great investment and they are so much better than the old ones
07/08/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,It works best if you manage the space that you want it ...,"Not having one of these robot vacuums before, it takes some getting used to.  It works best if you manage the space that you want it to vacuum.  That being to clear all items that will cause it to get hung-up on or around (chairs, tables, tight spots, day packs, dog toys, etc.).  By the time these items are cleared, I could have almost just vacuumed the area manually with an upright vacuum.The product itself works pretty well.  I would prefer if it had a structured pattern that it followed rather than randomly streaming through, around the room.  As it proceeds through it's process, if I watch it, I often wonder if it is really going to hit all locations.  Once I scheduled it to run daily, in the early morning (before we get up), I don't have to listen to it, and I don't have to wonder if it is going to do a complete job.  When I enter the living area, it seems to have done a decent job of vacuuming the area.  It needs help around the edges of the room."
05/06/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Really good,"No problems with it whatsoever, did a tonne of research so the only thing for it was post quality cheers!"

Unfortunately, Walle doesn't go easy on the furniture or walls. If you have white tables/chairs/bookends/baseboards, be prepared to watch the Roomba slam into them repeatedly during its work. Still a great purchase for maintaining ""clean"" floors, but may leave marks on your furniture."

10/31/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Some improvements, one 'pet' peeve","Nearly RIP: After using this Roomba several times a day almost every day, it has finally been sent to the children's room because it takes too frequent breaks.  (Charging issues.)  I hope it will continue to threaten children to pick up their stuff from the floor.I'm really impressed by the improvements in this Roomba.  Since I've put it into use in my household of pets - pets outnumber people 2:1 - the pet hair and dust have gone down considerably.  I have been using aÊNeato XV-11 All Floor Robotic Vacuum SystemÊand was about to order the animal and filter replacements but was sort of balking at the price.There are a few things that this machine does much better than the older Roombas and even some things that are better than the Neato.  The improvements are huge.Improvements:Directionality: This one has much better directionality than my older Roomba.  This one identifies a line, like the couch, and then a wall or coffee table, finds out its length and then comes back and does the area in a cross zigzag pattern.  My older one seemed to pretty much bounce off walls.Going around furniture.  This one goes around the furniture better than my past Roomba and better than my Neato.  I had sort of gotten into the habit of putting the chairs up on the table (difficult because they are antique wrought iron and heavy) because the Neato does not go close to the chair legs and seemed to go right through the middle - avoiding touching anything.  This Roomba is a great improvement though because when it touches something, like a chair leg, it clings to it while it goes around it, leaving no dust bunnies unmoved by the experience.The edges.  This one does better than my Neato.  It clings to rather than avoiding walls.  Neato would identify a wall line and then follow a path about one inch away from the wall.Cleaning. It is easier to clean these brushes than the old one was.  This one also has a better bin for emptying.This Roomba is like the energizer rabbit.  It just goes and goes and goes.  I charged it completely before I used it the first time.  About halfway through a 500 square foot room, it just turned around and didn't make it back to its base.  The next day, however, it did about 1000 square feet several times.  Maybe it was just trying to make up for the day before, but the animals didn't think it was funny, not at all.My `Pet' PeeveCleaning out the brushes is still a problem for me.  I just don't understand why it has to be done so often.  This needs to be cleaned at the end of every use.  This means I have to dig my fingers in and clean it.  This is precisely the one thing I never want to do.  I am allergic to pets AND their hair.My first Roomba was given away and now, my Neato has also gone to a new home.  This is definitely better than both of them."

11/13/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I couldn't love it more,"My wife kept coughing for some reasons.  Our doctor could not find any problem.  I was thinking it might be related to the carpet.  I hired the carpet cleaner to clean up the carpet once.  Then, I bought the iRobot to vacuum the bedroom every day, and vacuum other unused rooms every week.  My wife stops coughing now.  Every time, I clear the dust compartment of the iRobot.  I see the thick dirty dust.  It scares me that this is what I have been sleeping with.  The carpet just hides the dust so we could not notice how much it was in the bedroom.  There are many good things about the iRobot.  The best one is it reaches the area that is hard to reach, e.g. It vacuums the dust under the bed.  The other thing I like is it docks to recharge when the battery is low.  After talking the pros, I find 2 cons.  First, it does not work really well with the hard wood floor.  It just pushes the dust around.  Second, I have a black color rug with white color dots.  It confuses the iRobot that the dirt could not be cleaned so it will keep running in circle on the same spot.  In sum, it solves my problems, and I really really love it."

We run it every day and it just about does our entire downstairs (3200 square foot home, approx. 1500 sqft downstairs). Helps us keep up with the dog hair from our black lab. We still vacuum once a week, but it keeps us from doing it 3 or more times each week."

We wanted something that would just clean around 700sq ft of space upstairs without us ever having to haul around a vacuum.With 3 cats and a dog, our upstairs master bedroom and upstairs hallway are always coated in animal hair. Once a day the Roomba runs and takes care of everything. No need to haul the vacuum up and down stairs, the hallway and bedroom are always nicely vacuumed. It's a bit pricey for what it does, but it does it very well."
12/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Why did we wait???,"My wife and I had talked about getting one of these, but just didn't. Finally I read the Amazon reviews and decided what the heck. Now, after about a month, we ask ourselves ""why didn't we get this years ago?""This thing has made our chore of cleaning up dog hair a thing of the past. We have hardwood floors everywhere, with some throw rugs around, and a beagle mix house dog. This dog just blinks and drops about 500 hairs each time. We could never really stay ahead it.But now, with this Roomba, we come home to clean floors daily. Programming is simple, maintenance is easy, and we couldn't be happier. It does a fantastic job. It's specialty is cleaning along walls and edges, but will eventually cover the entire living area. The virtual wall device has kept it away from our Christmas tree skirt nicely. It goes onto any and all of our various rugs without hesitation. It only once had a problem while turning on the edge of a thin bathroom throw rug, and it signaled it was stuck. No biggie, I smoothed out the wrinkle and pressed the clean button, and away it went again.Truly, we are elated with this thing. No more do we have to see the dog hair mess. It's always in check now. And I am amazed at the apparent durability of this Roomba. They have certainly done their homework on this thing. We couldn't ask for anything more (well, maybe if it could dump its own dirt bin). Ha!"
8/25/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Good for square rooms,"My second one of these.  It works well.  Best for rectangular shaped rooms without too many objects in the room.  For me, the room to be cleaned needs to be prepped so the device doesn't get trapped under something.  This version has an rollers that don't need to be cleaned of carpet strands like the previous version."

8/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,it's the best buy ever,my precious! it's the best buy ever! forever! Every home needs one!
02/05/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Quite the Helper!,"My parents loved their Roomba, so I decided to go ahead and get one this past December.  I have 2 dogs and was having to vacuum every day to keep dog hair under control.  This Roomba works as advertised and has made keeping my floors clean soooo much easier.I auto set the Roomba to run our entire downstairs every morning before I wake up (tile floors).  It probably runs for a good hour and a half to two hours, then takes itself home to charge.  I empty the bin every morning, and once a week or so I flip it over and clean the removable parts.  This is very simple, and I had to do this with my regular vacuum anyways, so no biggie.  At lunch time, I take it upstairs (hard wood with area rugs) and let it run the rest of the house. It's just that easy.Overall, my house stays cleaner and I am much happier for it. I've also noticed a considerable reduction of dust in the air filter which is a big plus.  At the end of the day, this is totally worth it for all the time it has saved.  Thank you Roomba!"
3/31/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Perfect product,"My only regret is not getting one sooner.This is a great product, I love coming home to clean floors every day."
1/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,Not for a cluttered household,"My niece swears by this product, but she lives in a modern condo with polished concrete floors.  I've been in the same house for forty years with a mix of hardwood, vinyl, and tile floors scattered with area rugs.  These obstacles have greatly vexed the iRobot, which the cats in any case view with extreme suspicion."
12/26/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,My best buy for 2014.,"My new best friend.  It is so nice to have Robbie's  help.  I can dust while he vacuums.  Easy to clean,  I don't think he is noisy like some people have said. I am just so glad to have the help."
07/06/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,my new best friend!,"my new best friend!!!!!!!! i hate vacuuming. HATE HATE HATE. its annoying, it gets me tired and sweaty. its hard to get under the bed. but now, i can just sit and watch tv as i vacuum. does a great great job overall.PROS:- vacuums while you relax or at work- cleans super wellCONS:- nickel battery, so you have to be careful how you use it. you have to drain it completely before you charge it. and when you charge it, you have to charge all the way.- does fall down the stairs on carpet b/c it can't read the soft ledge as well. i recommend putting the portable lighthouse there- cant get into corners that are too small for it to fit. sooo, inevitably, you have to vacuum yourself sometimes in the little nooks- louder than i thought, but not awfuloverall, i still LOVE it. saves me a lot of time. and i can get the dust out of my apartment so much easier now."

04/06/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,A godsend for pet owners,"My new apartment has wood floors and the fur bunnies from my golden retriever became more apparent than ever. It made me insane. I was obsessed with sweeping and found that I had to do so daily which I don't have time for. Roomba picked up these dust bunnies in the interim until my housecleaning day (saturday). If you think this will replace your vacuum, it won't. It will help with those fur bunnies in the meantime. Saves me so much time. I love it."

2/20/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I like this little thing,"My kids were following it around the house the first day.  It's kind of fun, but it actually picks up quite a bit.  No regrets about buying this."

07/02/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Otto is da bomb!,"My husband named him Otto, our ""auto"" matic robot vacuum. I bought Otto with points on a credit card, hoping it would handle the daily tumbleweeds of cat hair from five cats and one dog (he doesn't shed). Other folks' reviews said it was good for pet hair, so I thought I'd try it since it's sort of free, as I could buy it with my points. And this is where I say...OTTO IS DA BOMB!This guy runs a room flawlessly. I'm watching him again tonight, navigating every spec of the floor, carefully pushing the small pile of dog toys out of the way, slowly rolling over the flippy flyer dog frisbee, working meticulously around chair and table legs. We've both noticed that sometimes Otto will miss a tuft of cat hair, and we make a mental note to check on it later to see if Otto came back for it and yes, he hasn't missed a thing! He transitions remarkably well from fwood (faux wood) floors onto area rugs, onto porcelain tile, to throw rugs, to plush carpet, no problem on anything. He has remarkable agility in managing varying heights. He can even roll up on to the base of a carpeted cat house, which has a good 1 1/4"" elevation from the floor.I'm shocked at just how much he collects on every single trip. Kinda scary, really. Running him in the bedroom was terrific because he cleaned under the bed very thoroughly, which is difficult with many vacuums. He can pick up a LOT of stuff as he cleans, including two catnip mice. It would appear that Otto has great sweeping abilities with his brush and rubber blade rollers, as well as good vacuum power.It sounds like we've given Otto a full identity. We have. And once you get yourself one of these remarkable machines, you'll think he's just as cool as we do! He does a heck of a great job cleaning the floors and carpets - better than most humans - and he's fun to watch! I still crack up when he stops, spins, and jukes back and forth real quick working a dirty spot. He reminds me of ""Wall-E"" and maybe that's why he's extra cool.Treat yourself to this magnificent invention! This is the gadget you thought was so cool when we watched The Jetsons!Well it's now the real deal and it's GOOOOOD!"
2/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,and it's like maids have been there,"My husband jokes that this Roomba (named Jeeves in our household) is my most beloved...well, yeah!  We have a 90 lb Akita, so trying to stay on top of sweeping and vacuuming is a nightmare with her.  Not now that we have Jeeves!  We get home from work, and it's like maids have been there....the floors are swept and my carpet is clean - it even has those lovely vacuum tracks to show it was freshly vacuumed!Jeeves navigates between rooms fairly well.  There is a bump between our kitchen and the living room, and I'd say he gets stuck there ~30% of the time.  Not a big deal to me.Also....poop.  Once, our beloved dog decided to dump a load in the kitchen while we were gone, while Jeeves was running.  Jeeves, plucky little guy that he is, went right in there and tried to clean it up.  Before he stalled out, he managed to fling poop all over the kitchen and wipe it on th baseboards.  0_0  It took us HOURS to get all that poop out of him and to sanitize the house.  It may have been the grossest thing either of us have ever had to work with.  Soooo, just be fore-warned, dog owners!!"
12/22/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Our New Best Friend,"My husband gifted me a Roomba six years ago. We returned it, because it wasn't performing up to par. We were sad to see it go, but it wasn't cleaning as well as we would have liked. Sooo, after many years, we decided to give it a other try. After all, the concept was ingenious.Relatively, we aren't big spenders. The kids hate to vacuum our main areas every other day (comprised of tile and wood). Yes, if I was a better mother, our floors should be vacuumed after every meal... Anyhow, my children miraculously agreed to put all of our money together and get one big family gift (ergo the Roomba 650) instead of individual presents.Oh my! Technology has changed the last six years. Our Roomba 650 (affectionately known as Estella) has added another notch to my happiness scale. My husband, the skeptic, was even amazed. He actually noticed and said things like ""Wow, the floor has never been this clean!"" The kids also observed how clean the floor was.I did a lot of research before purchasing. Here are some highlights:--- Some reviews recommended this model rather than the more expensive models. I agree. I don't have pets but there are three kids and seasonal allergies. I would end up losing the remote that comes with more expensive models, anyway. This model already allows scheduling.--- Our Roomba 650 has NOT gotten lost yet even though it goes into several rooms.--- As others have stated, it does get stuck among kitchen tables and chairs. My solution is to flip chairs onto the table/counter like they do at restaurants during closing time. My daughter likes to align the chairs in a line w/ a tunnel.--- The noise level is debatable because ""noisy"" is subjective. It is quieter than our three Dysons. I could hold a personal phone conversation but NOT a business phone conversation. It probably would NOT wake most sleeping babies. Possibly on the level of a cooking vent on low.--- It doesn't bother me to clean the dirt tray every time or every other time. For my house, I think we could even go four times before cleaning the tray. It was easy to pull out the tray, dump out contents, then rinse it."
01/05/2016,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,A Pet Owners Dream Machine,"My husband and I received a Roomba for Christmas from my mom who visits regularly and likes to keep things tidy.  Although we vacuum 2x week with our Hoover, we still struggle to stay on top of the heavy amounts of fur that shed from our dog and two cats (all long haired).  We have been running the Roomba in the mornings and evenings when we are home to keep an eye on it - it is on its second run of each room and still picking up hair and dust that our vacuum left behind.  The thing is a powerhouse and so thorough.  It is loud and the cats are definitely alarmed and curious about it but it is nowhere near as loud as the vacuum that sends all critters running into another room.  Looking forward to clean floors and less dust in our future!"
04/05/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,amazing,My floors havre never been cleaner. I set it up each day to vaccuum while I am at work. love this
04/04/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I really just wanted a cleaning robot!,"My fiance got this for me for my birthday after two years of joking that we should just get a roomba instead of cats. Two cats later I clearly lost that argument but I do finally have a roomba.The bullet points:- it's about 1/3 the volume of our standard $80 hoover upright vacuum. If I run it while I'm watching tv, I might have to turn the tv up to 25 instead of 21. I feel like I could probably sleep with it running around our bedroom but my fiance says he absolutely could not.- we have a 700 square foot apartment, mostly carpeted, with a galley kitchen. I have never had it not be able to find its way back to base. Unfortunately sometimes it doesn't get into the galley kitchen that well because of the layout.- if I want it to really thoroughly get under the table I just flip one of the chairs up before I run it. I've never had it get stuck in chair legs!- I have spent probably as much time maintaining it in a month as I would have running the full size vacuum once through all the rooms. To be fair I'm probably babying it a little as it's a $400 cleaning robot and I want to make sure it keeps ticking.- it IS strong enough to push your pet food bowls around the floor. You can get a halo sleeve for the virtual wall and keep it between the bowls, or just pick them up before you run it; we're thinking about getting a cast iron base both to protect them from the roomba and to keep our cats from dragging them across the floor. It's a pretty smooth ride though - the one time I forgot to pick them up it pushed the water bowl all through the kitchen without spilling any waterToday I did a science experiment. I ran the roomba yesterday, then today I tore apart both my vacuums, cleaned them thoroughly,  ran the full size upright to see how much I got out of the carpet, and then ran the roomba again. The upright got probably two cups of fur and dust and etc out of the carpets (pre-roomba I'd get easily 4-6) and then the roomba got a large handful of fur and dust up after that. I definitely find it a worthwhile purchase even if it isn't going to completely replace my upright. The main difference is that before I would run the full size upright maybe every two weeks or so; now I can run the roomba every day or every other day. It's cut down a lot on the cat hair just sort of hanging around in the carpet, which is great since I'm mildly allergic. I also have psoriasis which means I shed skin flakes myself - yuck - and this keeps our floors quite clean.Unintended side effect is that I actually probably clean MORE OFTEN than I did before I had a roomba, but mostly because I start the roomba and then I think ""well, I might as well wipe down the counters while that's running""... ""I might as well dust out the PC since the roomba will clean up all the hair and dust I get out of it""... and so on and so forth. Also since roomba does tile/lino and not just carpet, I no longer have to sweep which was my least favorite chore ever and so I mop more often since the roomba cleans the lino well enough that I can just mop it without doing any prep work.Also prepared to be grossed out at what the roomba will dig up from under your furniture or in the depths of your closet - I've found hair in the rollers from easily a year ago. My cats are at the cautious acceptance stage - one of them ignores it, while the other stalks it around the house and tries to scare it by jumping out at it. In contrast they are both still 100% terrified of the full size upright."
12/31/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,Three Stars,My daughter and son-in -law love the IRobot Roomba 650. Great job cleaning hardwood floors and thick rugs
01/06/2016,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Cool product but not a vacuum replacement by any stretch,"My bride has been in my grill for a year, maybe longer, to get a Roomba vacuum so, I got her this 650 model for Christmas.That went over poorly but ..... it is here and it is running around the downstairs like a little puppy and the bride uses the thing regularly so I am calling it good.Does it work good?  I am stating yes and no.  The little pan that catches dust etc fills up and has to be dumped so that means it is working.Personally, I think this thing may be best for getting under beds and chairs for dust.  I watched it in the kitchen on a tile floor for several minutes and it just ran over and past a few noticeable crumbs without ever picking them up."
12/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,An affordable housekeeper.,"My boyfriend has two large dogs and a cat.  I talked him into buying the Roomba.  It has been absolutely wonderful!  The Roomba cleans around all the edges, in the corners, under the bed and ottoman.  His house looks amazing!  We run it every day.  We named it Alice after the housekeeper in the Brady Bunch.  It really is like having a housekeeper."
5/24/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Fabulous For Pet Hair!,"My boyfriend brought over his Roomba 650 for me to try on my hardwood and Pergo floors. Though I'd Swiffered earlier in the day, I was blown away by how much cat hair, dust and assorted particulate it picked up! That sold me. I went to BB&B, got my own. Have used it three times in four days, and I'm still amazed by how much stuff it picks up. I have two cats that are prolific shedders. Roomba gets it all!!  Cleaning the brushes and bearings incredibly easy. People have complained about the difficulty cleaning these on older models. No problem with Roomba 650. If you have pets, or hate to vacuum, get a Roomba.  I'm thrilled with the purchase, pleased that it's an enormous time-saver."
03/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I'm so glad we did because it has been so easy cleaning ...,My boyfriend and I kept going back and forth on whether or not to buy one. I'm so glad we did because it has been so easy cleaning now. We have a dachshund who is quite the shedder. Our floors feel awesome after each cleaning. I wish it was easier to empty out the container but definitely a small con.
01/06/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba Is Perfect For The Busy Bees,"My background:Let me start out by saying that I am very picky and skeptical.  I read a million reviews before I buy product and base my purchases off of it.  I've always been intrigued with robots ever since I was a kid and couldn't wait for the day that robots started working for us around the house.  I've been following the progress of iRobot's Roomba series for several years now.  My aunt is a dentist and not only did she buy a Roomba for every level of her house, but she also gave away Roombas to her employees.  They all loved it, but experienced some issues.  I didn't go off of their feedback so much, but more off of my dad's because he's a quality inspector to those robot arms that build our cars and other things.  He's just as picky as I am, except he gets paid for it, ha!  I was excited, but very patient in waiting for iRobot to update their designs.  They continue updating their design, but I think they nailed it on this design.Here's what I've experienced:My wife was skeptical of the entire concept and obviously not as excited about the Roomba as I was, so I ended up paying out of my pocket and bought it for us as a ""Christmas present.""  I bought it, because we have a cat that likes to track kitty litter all over the floor and everybody who has ever owned a pet already knows about the pet hair issues.  Pet or human hair is not limited to specific rooms.  It floats around all over the place.  These are the things that drive me nuts.  My first run in with Roomba was when I borrowed it from my dad a few years ago.  I had a two story apartment that I was moving out of.  I just wanted to make sure that the apartment was decent for the inspection so I let the Roomba go around and do it's thing while I finished loading up the vehicle.  By the time I was done, it was done and charging itself on it's charging station.  Granted, it doesn't climb stairs so I had to physically move it, but it seemed to have done a decent job and I passed my exit inspection.  I didn't pay much attention to the Roomba during my moving process.Now that I own my own Roomba and it's the updated design, I pay very close attention to everything now.  People say that Roomba has a life expectancy of a couple of years, but my dad and aunt have only replaced their Roomba once within a 12 year span and their second Roombas are still going strong.  So anybody who has done their homework, might have read some old reviews claiming that cords get tangled in the Roomba, the brushes break easy, the front caster wheel gets jammed and scratches the hardwood floor, and the bin fills up too fast and you have to change it out halfway through.  Not on this model: ALL FIXED!PROS:* It charges fast* It memorizes your houses map* Parts can easily be removed for cleaning* The cleaning accessories work very fast* It's not as loud as a standard vacuum cleaner* You can schedule it to clean (without paying for extra addons now)CONS:* It only gets 97% of the dirt* It can run into table legs at full speed before it adds it to it's mapping* You're supposed to dump the bin out after every vacuum cycleCONCLUSION:If you have a scaredy cat like us, it helps if you run the Roomba while you give your pet attention so they know that Roomba isn't a threat.  After the second run, our cat began following the Roomba around because of curiosity. Roomba changed direction and came directly at our cat, but one swing at it's front bumper told Roomba to changed direction.  Now our cat sleeps through it's cleanings.  I'm leaving out information that you may have read in the description already, but I will say that I pet series is the way to go.  Tests have shown that it will vacuum up 97% of the stuff on the floor and it does do a great job at getting stuff out of the corners, but you will still need to vacuum once a month to get that 3% that it might miss.  I trimmed my hair and left clipping on the floor.  Roomba doesn't vacuum in the same pattern as humans so it was interesting to watch it map out the room in it's own special way, but the end result was that all of the hair got sucked up with the exception of where the floor meets the carpet.  That's where that 3% likes to hide.  My wife and I stay busy.  If we're not at work, we're spending time with each other.  The last thing that we want to do is drag the vacuum out of the closet.  My wife now loves the fact that the kitty litter trails and random dirt on the floor will get picked up while we're at work.  It gives us more time to spend with each other and our cat at the end of the day and that's what I appreciate about having Roomba around."
7/15/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Happy in Raleigh,Much more than I expected. Does a great job cleaning the hardwoods and carpet! Very satisfied!!!
9/30/2014,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"I may not use this like others, but then again, maybe everyone does it this way...","Most people probably use this differently than I do.  I don't like to let it have free reign in the house when I am not about or someone is at least there to watch it.  My negative list below defines why.  It is similar to the old Ronco set it and forget it, then warning people about fire if they don't watch the appliance.Still, this is so way cool and does such a great job, I love it.  Today, I tried a test I never thought this could pass.  I put down carpet cleaner/deodorizer on a rug and blocked it in the room.  And it took it an hour of running about, but it picked it all up.  Oh, and it filled twice, which is a good thing, but it does shut off when it fills, so if you aren't there to empty it, that extra battery life won't do you much good.The battery is powerful and lasts a very long time.  I haven't had an issue with it yet, but as I mentioned, I don't let it have full run of the house. But it merrily executes is algorithm, which is kind of clever as you start to identify it.  It can identify an edge by hitting it at a certain angle, and then it walks the edge.  I was impressed enough it did this with furniture, but when it also vacuumed the trip on the rug, I was kind of flabbergasted.The unit also has this find the dirt feature, in which it spirals for a bit looking for dirt before it heads towards the problem area.  Usually only when it first starts up, but it is also kind of a smart approach.They have come up with square units, and I do not think the algorithm could work as well.  Squares have corners, and they tend to hit things.  The round design bounces off.  Does seem to leave some traces here and there at times, but it will get them the next time it runs.As I mentioned, I do not use this in the way most people probably do, but then again, maybe it is what most of us do.  I let it go wherever it want at first, but it would snag something, get stuck, fill up or whatever, and it would stop, or worse, keep circling forever in a small area.One day, I couldn't find the silly thing.  I had left it to clean two rooms and it wasn't there.  I am beginning to think aliens.  But it had actually pushed away a smaller piece of furniture and broken into an adjacent room, snagged up on my cell phone charger and tried to digest my phone.  Fortunately, the system doesn't keep trying.  If the brushes and such lock up, it stops.  But not until it had dragged my cell phone by the cord across the room.So, my pluses and minuses, in which the pluses far outweigh the negatives....Positives:1. Way cool.2. Fun to watch, at least at first.3. If you hate vacuuming, it is also a great feeling to sit and use your computer while you let this thing run about and do it for you.  Would only take you five minutes, and this will take an hour, but you feel like you have help.4. The unit gets up so much it scares me.  I didn't think there was much of a visible difference one time, and I checked the bin and it was loaded with stuff.  Hairy, dusty, dirty stuff.  Hey, how did that get there? I vac at least twice a year.5. Brushes are effective.6. Climbs rugs and such effectively.  Small rugs may get snagged up though.  Thresholds which are common in older homes are no problem.7. Makes you feel smart for buying it.Negatives:1. When it gets to an overhang, like a flight of stairs going down, it just stops. I was hoping the sensor would pick it up and back up.  But it doesn't catch it.  You can use those invisible wall things, but I just move a couple of pieces of furniture to get the floor underneath them clean and use them to block the stairs.  Not a biggie, but I was kind of disappointed when it didn't manage it.2. I would not give it any demerits for this, because it has to be limited based its size, but it still is worth a mention.  The back has a tray into which the filth is thrown.  It isn't that large.  So, even a small room will fill it up, and it stops.  So, if you think you are going to go to work, come home, and find the entire apartment vacuumed, it isn't likely.3. It has a slight incline towards the center.  And I believe if I measure it, it would amount only to a centimeter or two.  But there is still furniture that is perfectly the exact height such that the front goes under, but it wedges before it passes under and jams up.  it gets scratches as a result just outside the white line you see in the picture.  And it will work like the dickens to get out, but eventually it surrenders.  So, I have to know these pieces of furniture and block them off.How do I use it?  I just take it to the area I want to vac and create a fence of obstacles. I don't care about the parking intelligence that takes it back to its home base.  I have not yet seen the battery get to the point where it would do that before it fills up or gets snagged up in some way.  I have done like three rooms and it is still charged enough to keep going once the dirt is removed and obstacles or snagged items have been effectively addressed.Right now, it is upstairs cleaning our bathroom.  To monitor it, all I have to do is hear it.  Some people think it is a bit loud, but that makes it better for me.  Silence indicates it has shut off.I would never go back on this purchase.  I would buy it again in an instant.  Would I buy all the gimmicks?  Maybe one or two for stairways, but most of the time, knowing its limitations allows you to easily determine an effective obstacle.I am not sure if you remember the robot toys and such that would move about the room, hit a piece of furniture or some obstacle, turn around and keep on going.  They were fun, but they didn't work everywhere in the house.  This does, and attacks hard wood floors as well as carpet, climbs the edges of rugs, gets under many pieces of furniture, and makes you often wonder how it did what it just did.That is cool, that is fun, and while the cool and fun are going on, there is actually work getting done too!!"

10/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Four Stars,Mom loves it. Period.
1/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Gets under the beds and furniture and that's great. We have all wood floors,May take a little micro managing at first. Runs every day and keeps the dog's hair under control. Took a few weeks to iron out our stuff on the floor. It gets snagged under a few spots in the kitchen once and a while. Gets under the beds and furniture and that's great. We have all wood floors. 1 story house. 1800 square feet. We like the noo-noo.
12/20/2012,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I love my roomba!,"many have mentioned that they name their roomba's and we are no exception.  Ours is named ""ham"" my son thought that would make the most sense.  We have 3 floors (finished basement with 2 large rooms, main floor with 5 rooms, and upstairs with 5 rooms.  However, we only have one area rug and the rest of the house is tile, wood, or painted concrete. The roomba can do 2 floors on a single charge.  The scheduler is overrated since you have to empty the bin and clean the brushes.  Long hair can get pretty tangled up but if you keep vigil it won't be a problem.  I'd much rather spend 5 minutes cleaning it thoroughly every 2-3 days and have a clean house than vacuuming as much as the robot does."
8/19/2013,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It's like you're living in the future!,"Man, buying a Roomba changed my life! It is so thorough and the fact that you can schedule it saves so much time and hassle. I had to disable the cliff sensors with strips of white paper and painters tape (google it for exact technique), because Roomba refused to go over my black carpet thinking it was a cliff. The operation was easy and because I don't have any stairs, I don't need the cliff sensors anyway. Besides that little mod, it runs like a dream. I have several thick cables running across some parts of my floor and Roomba just goes right over them without so much as a second thought. There is one section of my apt that it always gets jammed up in, so I set up the included invisible wall to keep it out of that small corner. Roomba won't even go near the actual invisible wall unit which is pretty cool. You can keep Roomba away from more than just rooms with it. Roomba cleans my hard wood floors and my low pile carpet equally well and moves from one to the other perfectly. I live in a one bedroom apt and a full cleaning cycle takes about 1 hour and 15 minutes. That's a lot longer than I would take to vacuum manually, but I wouldn't be vacuuming under the bed and a bunch of other various corners that Roomba happily takes care of. It feels great to always have clean floors. It is also very cool having a robot regularly clean for you. It's like being in the Jetsons. Roomba even makes fun sounds when it starts and finishes. I love this thing. It has dramatically improved my quality of life."
01/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Four Stars,Makes cleaning fun when you have pets
08/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Your house isn't ""Roomba Clean.""","You think your floors are clean?Ê They're probably not. The first time I unleashed by Roomba 880 on what I thought were clean hardwood floors and large area rugs, I had to follow it around and continually empty the bin and clean the filter. I was shocked. What appeared to be a spotless home simply was not. No wonder my allergies and sinuses were problematic.I scheduled it to run everyday for a week to vacuum a large open area (kitchen, dining room and sitting room) and put a lighthouse to the master bedroom. The bin emptying became less frequent. The hardwood glows. The carpets feel soft and new. Roomba even dusted the tops of the floor based lights. My allergies are under control and I imagine my Flonase purchases will slow. It now vacuums every other day and I only empty the bin when it finishes and is docked.Advice. Shim your doors open. Roomba is so intent on getting at dust along walls, it will push doors closed and imprison itself in a room."
09/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Yes, it works.Ê It works really, really well.","Yes, it really does work.Ê We have dogs who shed tremendously, and running the Roomba a couple of times per week seems to keep up with the mess very well.Ê The instructions recommend running the Roomba several times in succession over the same area to get embedded dirt and hair out, as the bin will fill up quickly.Ê Once we did that, we found that the Roomba could cover a large zone in the house before needing to return for a charge and to have its bin emptied.The extraction is excellent, even compared to my Hoover upright.Ê The longer I use the Roomba, the cleaner and brighter my rugs look and feel.Ê It's also rather fun to watch it bumbling around the room, like a bumblebee in a bottle.Ê It does a surprisingly good job of getting under furniture and into tight corners.We have a house with a semi-open floor plan.Ê It took a little figuring, but it was fairly easy to figure out a layout that divided the house into zones that were within the capacity of the battery and bin.Ê The Virtual Wall and Lighthouse units confine the robot into these zones, along with closing some doors. I find it easiest to run the Roomba in a zone, then empty the bin and let it recharge before moving on to the next zone.Ê Emptying the bin and replacing the HEPA filter are both easy tasks.It takes me about ten minutes to pick up things like dog toys, shoes, small scatter rugs and to move chairs the Roomba can't get under.Ê Then I turn it loose and go work on something else.Ê It tends to rumple up small rugs, but will ride right over larger rugs.Ê While it does not damage fringe, it does rumple it up a lot, so I don't run it over my expensive wool rugs. I do tuck electrical cords out of the way, but I have seen it encounter them several times, and it does not tangle itself in them.Ê I would be picking up and moving all of these things in order to vacuum anyway, so using the Roomba does not add any work.If you have a lot of open doorways, you may find it useful to get a third Lighthouse.Ê I was very confused about how to turn them off and on, until I realized that they turn themselves on and off when the Roomba is not active.Ê My instruction manual said they had an on/off switch - the later models don't have it.I have not used the schedule feature.Ê Our house is large enough that the Roomba and its charging station have to be moved from zone to zone.Ê Plus, with pets in the house I would prefer to run it when I am there to supervise it.Ê It has gotten itself stuck twice in the two weeks I have owned it.All other good things being said, it is not a substitute for a good upright with cleaning tools.Ê It can't be used on drapes or upholstery, or to clean cobwebs from the ceiling, and it certainly won't mop the kitchen floor (that's another IRobot product).Ê It is a huge help in keeping up with the day to day cleaning, and keeping the dust and pollen down.Ê My husband and one of our dogs have dust allergies, and they are both doing better since we started using the Roomba regularly."
11/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,LOVE our roomba,"Yes to everything everyone else said. LOVEÊ our roomba. But- be forewarned, if the battery dies- you have to reset all your programming! Completely ridiculous out of a $600 piece of equipment. It can't keep the clock set if it can't find its way back to the docking station. Customer service says I'm trying to clean too large of an area and not using my virtual walls (well my toddler runs off with them!). So, until my kid all grow out of toddler age, I will reset the entire schedule probably on a weekly basis. Ugh!"
10/31/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,My previous Roomba was working fine and I was reluctant to shell out the cash ...,"Yes there is a difference!Ê I have had every model of Roomba since the very first model came out.Ê My previous Roomba was working fine and I was reluctant to shell out the cash for the newest model, but I just had to!Ê It really has a lot more sucking power, and it is nice to not have to clean all that hair off brushes.Ê If you been wondering if there is a huge difference between this your previous Roombas, trust me, there is!Update, we dirtied 2 spots on the floor, a 2000 dollar boat anchor Kirby vs. Roomba.Ê Would you believe Roomba did as good if not better a job? When we figure out a way to do a more scientific test of these 2 will post a video.Ê The Kirby has been relegated to the garage.Ê The old advisory w that a Roomba does not substitute for deep cleaning upgright vacuum cleaners no longer applies.Ê In fact the New York Times I see stated the same thing, cleans as well or better then uprights."
6/16/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Great product, does a fine job.","Yes the dust bin is a bit too small but what can you do, other than make the roomba gigantic (and this is already pretty big).Ê That being said, this thing works great.Ê I even brought it into my work and had it vacuum the office my boss and I are in and he was very impressed with this little guy (and he doesn't impress easy).Ê The pathing on this is fine, but yes it will miss an area now and then but I have it cleaning three main rooms plus 4 small areas (bathrooms, kitchen, etc)...I have a child and two dogs (small and medium), and it's great.Ê They need to come up with a stair roomba next though.Now, a couple things...it has closed itself in the bathroom a few times now so I have to lock it out of areas where the doors aren't secured open (magnetic door stops) when I'm not home, but that's hardly the devices fault.Ê I had to buy small risers for my couch so it would go under there (the first day I ran it the sensor on the top wouldn't allow it under but the roomba tried, scratched the heck out of the top of the front bumper too.)Ê I recommend picking up rugs off the floor if you can.Ê It doesn't have an issue specifically but it doesn't seem to be terribly kind on the edges of them, lighter rugs will probably get jammed up in it (maybe)."
08/06/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I LOVE it! It is much more advanced in its ...,Years ago my son and daughter-in-law gave me one of the first roombas for Christmas.Ê It wore out several years ago and I sorely missed it.Ê This year I ordered the Roomba 880 for myself.Ê I LOVE it!Ê It is much more advanced in its cleaning power.Ê I didn't realize my floors could be so dirty and I don't even have pets!Ê I do have grandchildren though and they can be messy.Ê I did wait for the price to go down because I could not afford the full price.Ê Great purchase and clean floors!
06/11/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Big Improvement over Older Pet Hair Upgrade Kit, but Costly","Years ago I purchased the Pet Hair Upgrade Kit for my Roomba Scheduler.Ê It included a more intense brush, and a special brush cleaning tool.Ê However it clogged up so fast with hair that I switched back to the original brushes, and I just got used to the finicky amount of cleaning it needed.This model has rubber beater cylinders, rather than brushes, and a finer air filter to filter out allergens.Ê The rubber beaters work better because they don't get clogged up with pet hair.Ê The vacuum seems stronger, and cleaning seems easier.Ê Even if you don't have pets, if someone in your home has allergies, this might be a more helpful cleaner.Ê However, I'm not sure if the higher cost is justified -- I'll find out the next time we have people with cat allergies visit.The basic capabilities are the same as with prior Roombas, having overall room cleaning mode, as well as spot cleaning and setting up virtual walls to confine it to a specific cleaning area.The noise is sort of unpleasant (though not too loud), so in conjunction with the scheduler, we have used it as a signal to keep the day moving.Ê For example, you can set it to start up when it is time to leave the house in the morning -- that noise really motivates you to get moving.Ê Another option is to have it start up when it is time to take a break from work and go do lunch, though you have to be able to get far enough away from it so that it is not bothersome.It is also a fun pet toy, using the remote control to drive it around the floor like a remote control car."
07/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,This thing is amazing. 2 cats 1 dog and dark hardwood floors,"Yeah, it's pricey. I kept the box just in case it was a dud. This thing is amazing. 2 cats 1 dog and dark hardwood floors. Every day at 11:15 it starts up. 1500 sq ft of wood. It does an amazing job. I do have to empty it a couple of times. No big deal. Once a week you have to remove the rubber wheels and dust them off. Also very easy. It does get hung on electrical cords. So. I've had to raise them up off the floor. I highly recommend this product."
9/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great product and value,Wow...great roomba
6/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Solution for pet hair.....not so much :(,"Wow....so disappointed in this little vac.Ê I bought the highest end one they make that is supposed to be for pets, but I'm sure not sold on it's ability to pick up pet hair.Ê Granted, my house is a HUGE test of a vacuum cleaner's ability to pick up pet hair.Ê I breed Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and have six of them that live with us.Ê But, all 6 put together don't much more than equal one large Golden Retriever or any other large breed dog, so I don't think I'm asking for the moon here when I want a vacuum that will do a decent job on pet hair.Ê I am a fairly fastidious house keeper and I am ALWAYS vacuuming.Ê I'm thinking of fashioning a holster for my dust buster! The Roomba does a reasonable job on hard surface floors, but how hard is that?Ê Any midrange vac can pick up pet hair on tile or hardwood.Ê But, I find that on my 5 x 7 area rug, all it seems to do is kind of ruffle it up into little wads, but then doesn't have to suction power to pick it up.Ê And yes, I clean the filters and the brushes very often.Ê I turn the thing lose daily so as to try to keep ahead of any build up of hair on the rug, but even with daily passes, it still just doesn't get the job done.Ê I want so badly to love this little guy, but alas, he is not the bosom buddy I'd hoped for.Ê The IDEA of a little helper that scoots around all day while I'm at work picking up dirt and dust and dog hair is so appealing to me, but I have now had both a Neato (which picked up the pet hair better but had ""brain issues"" every few months until the company refused to replace it any more) and now even the high end Roomba has let me down.Ê So far, I haven't experienced any of the brain farts that the Neato used to have where it would say that the dirt bin was full when it wasn't or getting stuck in the middle of the room saying there was an obstruction when there wasn't, but it's still too early to tell with the Roomba as I've only had it about a month.Ê I guess my take is, if you are looking for a pet hair solution, this isn't it.Ê So sad that Roomba is not the handy helper I had hoped for."
6/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Get one, now!","Wow, why didn't I get one of these years ago!Ê I ran the vacuum the day before getting this, and thought that the rugs were fairly clean...Ê The amount of dust and dog hair that this got up indicated otherwise.Ê I'd recommend having this systematically clean individual rooms, and then run on a daily basis once the initial cleaning is done.Ê The dustbin is small, but hopefully with frequent use this won't be an issue.Ê The rubber rollers are GREAT at getting up the hair, sand, and dust, and are super easy to clean.Ê I always needed a scissors at the ready when I vacuumed to cut off all of the long hair that wrapped around the rollers, but that isn't necessary with the Roomba.Ê It is not nearly as loud as the vacuum, and I can have a phone conversation when it is running under my feet without issue.Ê It has tackled electric cords and network cables without sucking them up or getting tangled.One word of warning though...Ê I have had this get stuck under my cabinets, since the floor tile was added after the cabinets were installed and the height from floor to the bottom of the cabinet is no longer standard.Ê Obviously not the Roomba's fault, but it is a minor annoyance.Ê I use the virtual walls to keep this out of the kitchen during the overnight programmed vacuuming sessions, and just do the kitchen during the day when I can be around to help it get unstuck.Ê You may want to measure for this as well as any furniture that might pose other sticking hazards."

My main critique would be a lack of a remote control function to find it when it is stuck. Also, the dust carrier does not hold much, and is difficult to empty.That aside, it scurries around like a tireless worker, and seems to find a lot of dust and fuzz - I've no idea where."
12/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Almost perfect but ?,Works pretty good. Only complaint I have is emptying the dust bin. There is a grate under the filter and that blocks the picked up material from being emptied easily. After the warranty is over I plan to cut some of the plastic grate away so I can just dump it instead of having to pick at it. If it was not for this one design flaw it would be almost perfect. I am still surprised how much this thing picks up off the carpet even after a regular vacuuming. So now I just let this thing run everyday and leave the big vacuum in the closet. it is also very quiet in comparison to a regular vacuum and it does not scare the my little dog like my other vacuum does. So once the warranty is up it will be better after I modify it as that is the one area that kinda pisses me off as I really do not want to touch any vacuumed up material.

7/15/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Works awesome for pet hair,"Works awesome for pet hair, with 2 German Shepard mix dogs, shedding was a nightmare and regular vacuums would clog and hair would wrap around the brushes. with the redesign on the 880, it pulls hair out of the carpet with minimal tangles. any tangles that happen are easily removed thanks to the tangle groove that allows wrapped up hair to fall off the roller, just release the roller from the housing and slip the hair off the end.some people complain of the roomba slamming into things, but if you watch, it actually slows down as it near objects and gently taps them to clean as close as it can. it easily travels under my couch that has a torn bottom fabric and it comes through without getting tangled. the patterns it runs can be somewhat erratic, but from what i've seen it travels at different angles to help pull more out of the carpet bc it may miss things going head on, but at a slight angle it will pick it up. This may not be the vacuum to end all vacuums, but it is worth it to me for its ability to keep up with the shedding."

7/23/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Great if you love fixing vacuums!,"Worked well for about a week.The things i have had trouble with are...Ê Dust bin is not easy to empty. When it gets filled with hair you have to root it out through a small slot. Just not designed well.Ê Intake duct under rollers will clog .Once this happens no more dirt will be picked up The vacuum will continue to roam aroundÊ aimlessly.Rotary brush stopped working after a month. Now works about half the time.This is with two small Pug dogs,not a house full of cats or large dogs. Given the high cost of this unit I expected equally high performance and quality. Now instead of spending time vacuuming I work on keeping it operating."

10/01/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I can't spend that much. I'll try it out. It's incredible. It was money well spent.,"Without question, this is a borderline idiotic amount of money to spend on a vacuum, much less a robotic ""toy"". I couldn't get myself to buy one for the longest time because I would think of what else could be done with $700. That was what I thought at least, until I had used it just twice. We have one dog - a golden retriever - and I am not joking when I say we were mortified at the sheer amount of hair, dust, and dirt that the Roomba picked up. Even over areas we had vacuumed the day before. In our bedroom we had to run it FIVE times before it started coming back empty. Again, this area had just been vacuumed thoroughly the day before.We have some Persian rugs with long tassels and it has absolutely no trouble keeping itself from getting stuck.Pros:- Better suction and pickup ability that ordinary handheld vacuum- Gets under things you just cannot- Scheduling, charges itself- Doesn't get stuck on cords, tassels, etc...- Forces you to stay clean! You simply cannot leave things on the floor anymore.- No brushes!Drawbacks:- Must be emptied after nearly every cleaning- ExpensiveI have been most impressed by what a wonderful job it does vacuuming carpet. I expected it to clean our wood/tile floors well, but it is unbelievable how much junk it can pull up. As I said before, my absolute favorite part is how we must now make sure all the rooms are picked up daily otherwise the Roomba cannot do its job. It has literally turned our household from slobs to neat freaks overnight. Find another way to do that for only $700."

And all it eats is dirt. <3. If you are wavering between cheaper versions don't hesitate anymore. This roomba is worth every penny. One thing- never know if those remote towers are working or not. But the roomba has a knack for remembering where the house really needs cleaning. Have plenty of c batteries in stock for the towers though.

08/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Best.Purchase.Ever.,"WHY DIDN'T WE BUY THIS SOONER???!!! This is the best home appliance purchase we've made in a long time. I read EVERY review on Amazon before this purchase. And we've had ours now for several months. My thoughts and tips:We don't use the scheduling - at least not as a rule. I find Miss Roomba does a better job if you make sure she works awhile in a specific area that is partitioned off by using either closed doors or the lighthouses or a mixture of both. Also, she's like any maid. She cleans better if you pick up a bit before she gets started. : )Ê Since she has come to work for us, we've done a much better job of ""cord management"" around lamps and electronic devices so that she doesn't get hung up. She can and does get loose but why waste her time? In the bathroom, I have her run once without the rugs down and then when she is finished I put them back down and have her do another sweep so that they get a good cleaning too.It's worth it to have a vacuuming robot just to clean under surfaces you don't regularly clean. Under our beds, under tables and side tables and chaise lounge. It's amazing where she can go.As to the noise factor, she isn't silent. But there is something soothing about hearing her clean. I run her every morning in our bedroom after I make the bed.It works best when cleaning our her dust bin to take the filter outside where you can bang it hard against a hard surface and not worry about where the dust flies. Keeping the filter clean is important to her power. We ordered a box of extra filters so that we can put a clean one in frequently and then rinse them out from time to time.We have ""joint custody"" of our grand dogs. Its amazing how much harder Roomba has to work when they are here. I don't think I realized before how much pet hair they really shed. But our little vacuuming robot can get it all up.I so wish I'd purchased Roomba sooner. She makes life so much easier. I was a little reluctant to make the purchase - it seemed like a lot of money. Honestly, I've never been so impressed with a vacuum, home appliance or home helper of any kind -- ever."
5/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Best Roomba with the Lowest Maintenance Yet,"Why did we wait so long to buy this? We have had Roombas before and they have given us a long and productive service life. But when our last one died, we just went back to using the regular push vacuum.Ê That was a big mistake. No one is going to vacuum their house as often as they would if it is as easy as pushing a button.Ê Plus, we all have better things to do with our time.Ê Besides, can you vacuum under your bed or dresser with a regular vacuum? I didn't think so. So stop hesitating and just go ahead and purchase this Roomba.I am glad we got this model because it truly is much less maintenance than prior models.Ê We have 2 cats and we have never had to clean the main brushes. We have had to pop off the rotating wheel and clean that every so often but its super easy to do.Ê Plus, this one comes with a remote control, so you don't have to corral Roomba in order for it to abide by your will.Conclusion: Just get it. Yeah, it is a lot of money to spend on a vacuum, but your house will thank you for it."
08/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Do not give up your upright just yet!,"While the Roomba is good for upkeep, it is not your deep clean vacuum.Ê Does very good on hardwood and alright on carpets.Ê Do not expect to get rid of your upright."
5/13/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,Roomba the Toy,"When you have a Euro wife that goes back to see family every year, then you need all the help you can get. Roomba 880 was ordered the day she left and so me and cats got to know our new friend.Ê That's the issue...cats.Ê My wife shows long hair Siberians (really shows them..one is US neutered champ) and so our house is regularly covered in fine cat hair.Ê The answer has always been to vacuum a couple times a week and we keep a very presentable home.Ê I assembled Roomba..very easy..read up on it and set it free.Ê It did well not going down the stairs that I had put a virtual barrier, it got out of close chair legs and all was well until it hit the cat hair. Its smeared it...yes...smeared it.Ê I ran it over the cat hair a couple of times until me and cats got bored and then I emptied the Roomba trash collector tray. Very little cat hair.Ê So I get out the great Kenmore vac and get up the cat hair in about 10 minutes.Ê Back goes the Roomba to Amazon...all is well on that end, but very disappointed that little Roomba is more of a toy than tool.Ê That too is the conclusion of the WSJ article in May of 2014.Ê In fact little Roomba is moving product defect by virtue of its advertising.Ê The Uniform Commercial Code 2.314 and 2.315 applicable in all states, requires products to meet both normal fitness requirementsÊ as well as special attributes such as picking up cat hair...""Cleaning Robot for Pets and Allergies"".Ê It is neither fit for normal house cleaning and it sure isn't fit for pets and allergies. Thus if you live in an tiny apartment which is meticulouslyÊ kept clean and you need a cleaning toy, Roomba may be just the useless expenditure you have been looking for.Ê But if you have a real job to do, go to Sears."
9/20/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,worth the purchase but not perfect,"When it works, it's awesome!Ê But it doesn't usually make it back to its charger on its own, which is what we understood it would do.Ê Not a big deal, just not what we expected.Ê Also, sometimes it doesn't cover all of the rooms.Ê It just vacuums one room then goes back to the charger.Ê However, it is such a help with keeping pet hair under control (we have 4 dogs that are inside / outside dogs), that we would definitely not want to be without it."
06/12/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,What A Fabulous Device,"When I think of roombas, my mind goes to the episode of Parks and Recreation where Tom Haverford mounts an iPod to his roomba and named it DJ roomba. Interestingly enough, the manual for the roomba explicitly states one should not mount anything to the top of their roombas. Anyways, this robotic vacuum cleaner is great. It is easy to set up, essentially you can take it right out of the package and use it. I let it charge for a bit and then let the roomba do it's thing. The algorithms can be pretty confusing, the roomba cleans in what seems like a nonsensical path and can be excruciatingly slow. However, it does a good job cleaning deeply the first time you run it. Afterward, it takes less time to clean the room but still does a fine job. I will state that other people mentioned the roomba gently hits furniture, unfortunately the one I have seems to slam right into the coffee table among other things. It also gets stuck going over the stair ledge. However that's a matter of me not cleaning the cliff sensors. If you decide to get one of these, be sure to wipe it's sensors down often and to continuously empty the bin where it collects the dirt. It takes about five minutes to do this which is nothing compared to how much time it would take to vacuum yourself. Really, this is the perfect device if you're looking to cut some chores from your life and to save on time."
10/20/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Five Stars,What was life like before my Roomba.Ê Dirty.Ê This is my years best purchase!
7/21/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,I like it but its not perfect,"What is our Roomba up against?2 huge Golden retrievers (one being 70lbs and the other so tall he is slim at 90lbs)4 rescued/adopted indoor cats (we rescue and foster so often have extra kittens we are fostering)1 13 year old teenage girl (and her friends)1 17 year old boy (and his friends)1 20 year old college student who splits his time between dorm and home (and his friends)1 husband ~ messier then all the above1 frazzled housewifeLevel of cleanliness: before roomba vacuumed 2 times a day. 3 times if company was comingFloors: no carpet, only wood and tileI was excited to see the ""for pets"" Roomba for obvious reasons =)This machine is not going to spring clean your home for you, lets just get that out of the way right now. It misses stuff. Its not perfect. However it does a better job then my kids AND my husband when I ask them to sweep the floors. I don't like a lazy Roomba. If I see its fully charged I am pushing that ""clean button""! On average I think I am pushing the button 4-5 times a day? I don't keep track as the other family members push the button as well. Over time it does pick up everything. It gets the walls and corners which seem to always get missed when the above are sweeping. It does pick up the hair that is on the floors and keeps it to a minimum. I went from sweeping 2-3x a day to once every other day or so. That is a huge time saver right there! I don't find it as loud as many on here. I have a Dyson and the Dyson is tons louder. The Roomba makes noise. Its going to make noise. ITS A VACUUM. I don't find it overly loud but I don't turn on Roomba while watching a movie either.The bad or room for improvement:The bin is still too small. Two goldens shed a lot of hair. In our large family room I have to empty the bin once (and sometimes twice) a session. That is getting better as I am using the Roomba more and more but still wish that bin was a bit bigger!!I don't think it would do as good of a job on carpet. I have area rugs and it always misses stuff on the area rugs. It does a decent job on them but not great. However on my wood floors and tile it gets everything.I hope this review helps. Roomba is not a miracle worker. Your not Cinderella with little magical birds and mice flying out of it and cleaning your entire room for you. Feel free to whistle while you work though.For my family its a great tool to keep pet hair under control."

I was recently diagnosed with dust mite allergy and thought I would use this as an excuse to get a Roomba.I've been wanting one for a while and was very excited when I got it.however, it just didn't work for our space... it was constantly getting stuck between furniture and other part of the house. Every time we would get home we would find Roomba stuck somewhere.. either stopped or sometime trying to get out of where it was a ruining the floor by doing so.on the plus side, the few times it worked, it collected a lot of dust.I didn't think our house was such a death trap for Roombas but apparently it is.Amazon was great though and offered to take it back."
6/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,No going back!,"What a difference! Some months back a friend gave me her old but working Discovery model. I used it until I couldn't get it to 'go' any longer (about a year). Once you've used a Roomba on top of your usual cleaning there's no going back. Since one of our family members is a Norwegian Elkhound I opted for the best available model for pets and allergens. Ours is a two story home with hard surfaces on the ground floor and carpet on the second. Roomba does an equally impressive job on both. Drop offs like stairs, fringe on rugs do not pose a problem. Now all I need is a 'stair iRobot!' Edited to include that the 880's profile is lower than the Discovery, and the towers, batteries included, are in the box."

Every part of this item was built by experienced engineer. Wise mechanical construction, wise software, well built unit. Engineers, if you are reading this review, your construction of brushes is a real miracle! You really solved problem of the long hair!PROS- detects wires and carpet's edges and bypass them- easily can deal with hair (I have cat and my wife have long hair) and much-much-much better then ""bobSweep pet edition""- cheap parts- good customer service- easy to clean- long battery life- dirt detectionCONS- expensive- as other cleaners, afraid of black patterns on a carpet. this can't be fixed at all, you have to return it if you have black patterns.

5/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Robot Vacuum Nightmare Scenarios Realized,"We've had this roomba for about 9 months now and, while it's done a remarkable job in a few places, especially picking up our dog's hair, it's done a lot of things poorly and perhaps a few things so terribly I wish I could go back and not have the roomba.Ê So, to keep it brief, here's a quick overview of the things that we ran into over the preceding 9 months:1. This roomba will never make it over the slight bump from our flat kitchen floors to the carpet.Ê The moment it enters the kitchen area it will never ever return to the carpeted area.Ê Having a dock is worthless.Ê Having the lighthouses doesn't help at all, the roomba still slips into the kitchen area and is lost to us until it dies.2. Despite our best efforts, the roomba fails to get under and around our dining table.Ê The only solution is to remove the table completely from the room or just let the roomba do it's thing around that area (when it's not stuck between a chair's legs) and then come back through and clean up later.3. The roomba is incapable of negotiating an area that might have two parallel, long spaces that can be entered and exited from two different, far-away, spots.Ê This has meant that the roomba is unable to clean half our house automatically.Ê Having a fancy scheduling system doesn't add any value.4. After 9 months, the roomba is exhibiting incredible symptoms of failure.Ê It rarely can move along the carpet in a straight line despite every effort to clean and maintain the thing.Ê Very low maintenance feels like almost a lie.Ê And the device makes loud cla-clunk noises as it moves around cleaning.And here's the thing that gives me nightmares:One crazy night shortly after a vacation our Roomba had once again forgotten it's scheduling.Ê Well, it'd actually lost track of time and the schedule still was going to happen no matter what.Ê So, that evening we opt for a comfy dinner.Ê The puppy is left to guard the house.Ê And all's well.Ê That is, until, the roomba kicked on at an actually unpredictable time and rapidly cornered our puppy who's scared of the monster vacuum already.Ê Unfortunately, the roomba didn't let up and after the guy was cornered, he finally lost it and peed.Ê Then, out of the goodness of Roomba's heart, it moved that puddle of pee all over our apartment.Ê Professional cleaners had to come in to repair the damage.So, yeah, great robot vacuum, I guess.Ê For the price I paid, I think I might have been a lot better off just hiring a maid.Ê And heck, the thing is already falling apart, 9 months into it's supposed very maintenance free life.Ê I don't think so."
02/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,IRobot Vacuum ... not suitable for all floors and areas?,"We've had this model for several months and it's been troublesome. It got caught under the dishwasher several times. Likewise, it got stuck several times in chairs and tables. But the biggest issue has been with the wool rugs and runners. For instance, the leading edge of a new , wool runner is showing signs of wear. The unit appears to shear the wool fiber on our large living room rug. The unit is always full, ""stuffed"" with fiber, after every cleaning so much so that the unit never makes it back to the dock. I wipe off the fiber from the unit every day. I know that some have written that on new rugs it is normal to remove lots of fiber but that's not the case here. So if you have rooms with thick wool piles I would not select this unit.We moved the unit to kitchen with attached family room where we have mostly wood floors and some thin nylon rugs. I'll give it a try and report back."
06/01/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Another huge step forward in the Roomba line!,"We've had several different Roombas over the years, and even a few competing models from other companies.Ê With almost all of them, the cleaning that they did and the convenience that they provided has been wonderful and improved with each new model.Despite they constant progress, the effort required to clean the brushes out was the one flaw that always made us wonder if vacuuming robots were even worth the cost and time.Ê Because we have two dogs that shed a lot, we've always opted to accept having to spend 15 or 20 minutes each week cleaning the hair out of the brushes, especially since that brush cleaning has gotten slightly shorter and easier with each new model of Roomba.This Roomba 880 has largely solved the hair in the brush issue.Ê Its new design is dramatically better than previous ones, both in getting the hair into the bin, instead of onto the brushes, and making it easy to remove the hair that does end up on the brushes.We highly recommend this robot, especially for pet owners.Ê It is quiet, thorough, and simple to operate and clean up.Ê It is great."
11/10/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,now it works great for our main living area,"We've had ours for a few months now. It took some trial and error to get the most out of it. But, now it works great for our main living area. I do wish the Towers/Virtual Walls were a little cheaper. You'll end up needing more than the 2 that comes with it."
10/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Our Daughter Named Her ""Lamie""","We've had Lamie now for nearly a year, and she's like a member of the family.Ê Care and feeding is a breeze - She lets us know when she needs to be emptied or charged or cleaned, which isn't often.Ê She's always willing to work, needs minimal or no attention, and consistently does a terrific job.Her lighthouse units reliably guide her through doorways and away from areas we'd like her to stay away from... the fireplace, for instance.We have a large house.Ê My wife's a neat freak.Ê We host lots of guests and need to keep our home clean.Ê Lamie works so we don't have to.Thank you Lamie."
07/03/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,What a cleaner,"We've had iRobots for several years now.Ê The 880 series is a significant improvement over the 770 series.Ê We have two, and they are used every day."
8/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,"Only designed to cover 533 sq feet, no company literature tells you that!!","We started with an 870 series and where it seemed to clean the entire main floor and return to the doc, it was crossing the entire main floor a lot which seemed inefficient, so we upgraded to the 880 because of the lighthouses.Ê The two weeks we had the 870, it would clean the entire floor and doc itself each team.The 880 however has been a nightmare for proper functioning...it will spend 35 minutes cleaning the same room over and over again until it eventually drains the battery and dies in the middle of the floor.Ê It doesn't seem to have programming that goes, ""hey, I'm almost out of juice, I should abandon what I'm doing and return to base"".Called iRobot and eventually customer care said, ""well it is only designed to clean 533 sq feet so turn a lighthouse into an invisible wall, cut your 1100 sq foot main floor in half, let it clean half and dock...then after it is recharged carry the robot to the 2nd area and let it clean the 2nd area"".Ê What?Ê Really? I'm going to carry this thing around?It's been too long for us to return it to the store so we are stuck with it, but I wouldn't buy one again as the 1100 feet isn't really 1100 feet with all the furniture and an island in the kitchen, but that isn't the point.The robot isn't simply smart enough to figure out it is almost out of juice, and dock to recharge...it simply stops and dies...really simple bit of programming they seemed to have missed in the 880."
7/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,Returned It,"We returned it. It worked fine for a week or so, but even then I had to redirect it because it has a strange cleaning cycle.Ê After that, it decided it couldn't clean around my dining room table.Ê I tried everything to fix it, consulting videos at the Roomba site and cleaning everything, etc., but it would stop short around the table over and over again.Ê If it won't clean, what's the point in keeping it."
12/02/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,nice to wake up to clean rugs,we replaced our older roomba which we had all but worn out with this newer model. the algorithm that it uses to search out the dimensions of the room appear a bit different. the room seems to get covered more efficiently but in very weird situations it can get trapped. floor wise it really cleans the rugs well. we use it every night at 2am and it cleans our entire 1st floor which is a large living room a large dining room a kitchen a small bathroom and a small bedroom. its nice to wake up to a clean floor. (btw we got a new battery for the older roomba and gave it to our daughter where she is using it for a smaller house with two large dogs).
11/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,"Great vacuum to HELP with cleaning, but won't replace human effort","We recently moved into a new house with hardwood floors all throughout the main level and carpets on the second floor. We already owned a Dyson but that has proven to be more effective for deep cleaning carpets than hard floors, so when my parents offered to get us a housewarming gift I asked for money to put towards this.My husband - who researches everything and upsells me on nearly ALL THE THINGS! - decided this was the model he wanted above all others; we have 2 kids, 2 short-haired cats, a 75 lb dog that doesn't shed but has enormous paws, and a yard that's 95% sand, so I was inclined to agree with him. We dock this under a free-standing, raised cabinet so it's out of the way but in a central location, and I run it on our main floor just about every other day (I've never brought it upstairs or used it on the second carpeted floor).While I am very happy with Rosie, she's not an alternative to floor cleaning for me; rather I work alongside it to make sure my floors get fully cleaned. Our dog drags a ton of sand inside the house and it gets EVERYWHERE, so before I run the Roomba I take everything off the floor that can be moved, including our dining table chairs, throw rugs, our dog's bed, his food dishes, and a step stool that we keep a basket on with my kids' snacks; I also close the bathroom door because Rosie has gotten stuck in that room more than once by closing the door by accident. Then I take a microfiber dry mop and gather up as much loose sand as I can get; I generally sweep that into a dustpan and remove it, rather than letting the Roomba pick it up, since the dust bin doesn't have a huge capacity (I always empty it after each run).Our downstairs is approximately 750 sq ft and the Roomba takes about 75 minutes to clean the entire area, which is not an insignificant amount of time. We have a fairly open floorplan with just one hallway and no doorways or stairs for it to navigate, so it moves pretty freely in what always seems to be THE most random pattern, but it nearly always reaches every section that I need it to clean (sometimes it misses my front hallway, for reasons I don't understand).It's not prohibitively loud; I can still have a conversation with other people while it's in the room, but I wouldn't attempt to talk on the phone with it working nearby; I often turn on the TV while I'm cleaning and have to crank up the volume AND turn on closed captions to know what's going on over the Roomba noise.I have to keep an eye on her because she sometimes gets stuck while cleaning under my dishwasher - which is just SLIGHTLY closer to the floor than the surrounding cabinets - and under one of our couches; it makes a pretty awful screeching noise while it tries to free itself, and if I don't get to it in time it will audibly tell me there's an error.That being said, the side brushes get all the grains of sand from underneath my baseboards that a dry mop and other vacuums can't get to (I also occasionally use a Swiffer Vac when the broom and dustpan won't cut it but I don't have time to run Rosie). It also does a really great job on my area rugs, which means I don't need to drag my Dyson down the stairs to specially take care of those. I always wet mop the floors when it's finished vacuuming, and this really does prep the area well for me to do that chore.All in all, the Roomba is absolutely a luxury item, not a necessity. If we didn't live in an area with so much sand I likely wouldn't have invested in this machine, but I don't regret the purchase. It's not perfect and does require a fair amount of prep work in order to run it, so I don't have it set to operate on its own each day (that's a fun feature, but just not practical for my house).I regret to say that I'd never be able to convince my cats to ride it, but I'm happy that it's not so threatening to the dog that he feels the need to defend himself - or us - against it. I have discovered small green Army figurines going for a ride on it, though, so at least *someone* has used it as a thrill ride."

7/31/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,"It isn't perfect, but I'm glad we have it.","We really like this thing. It vacuums very well, though like others have mentioned it can have a difficult time navigating changes in elevation in the floor. We have particular issues on our fireplace hearth and unfortunately there's no good way to keep it off as far as I can tell. Doesn't hang every time. I love the programmable feature - we have the machine run every night at 1am, and when we wake up the hardwood floors are clean.Not a replacement for periodic deep cleaning, but if you have a pet this thing is a must. I'll give it 5-stars when they get the elevation change thing sorted out and ship it with something that holds the charger base in place. To help with that I recommend getting some non-skid pads. If the base moves at all it can confuse it and you'll wake up the next morning in the middle of the floor with a dead battery.Easy to clean the unit thoroughly. Picks up so much stuff that we have to clean it out every other day at least."
11/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Excellent vacuum that has exceeded our expectations,"We purchased the Roomba 880 over a month ago and we are extremely satisfied with it. We have a dog that is a German Shepard mix and a cat and it does a great job vacuuming up the hair. The basin will fill up quickly the first couple times you run it but if you run it every day like we do, it won't fill up as quickly. If you stay ahead of the fur like we do, it will fill up ""normally"" but of course it depends on your situation. The great thing is that while it's running, you can do other household chores which makes your day more efficient. I highly recommend the 880.I went through some of the questions and I'll try to answer the ones that match our situation;-We have fringe on two oriental area rugs and it does not get caught nor does it tangle. We have a dark design on ours and it has no problems cleaning them-It will not damage the baseboards. As it approaches the walls, it slows down as it can sense it-For our house (4,000 sq ft) it will not do the house on a single charge-We do have an open floor plan and if you use the lighthouses, it will do all rooms. You just need to setup multiple lighthouses-We have hardwoods on our main level with area rugs and it has no issues cleaning both areas-We have full carpet upstairs and it does a great job with cleaning it and getting all the animal fur up-Like anything else, if you want it to last you'll need to do a little maintenance like cleaning it up, replacing the parts as recommended. For the amount of money we spent on this, it is not a deal breaker for us-Just like a normal vacuum, you'll have to carry this upstairs and downstairs to clean those rooms along with lighthouses-We have raised pet feeders for our dog and cat and it will bump it but it won't move them-It can detect a ""cliff"" if it goes near stairs and ours does not go over-If the clearance is high enough, it will go under bureaus, dressers, beds, couches, etc. and it will clean underneath-It has not scratched our hardwoodsFor those asking how long does it take to (insert situation here) or will it scare my animals or how long does a charge last, etc. those are hard questions to answer because everyone's situation is different. The great thing about Amazon is that if you don't like it, you can return it within a certain period of time.I think I covered the more common questions so I hope this helps."
04/06/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,So worth it!,"We purchased the Roomba 880 directly from iRobot right when it came out. We were looking for a new vacuum anyway, and the reviews about how it handled pet hair sold it for us. We have 2 cats in 1,000 sq ft apartment. It's a constant battle against cat hair and tracked litter. So far, the Roomba has done really well with both! The rubber rollers on the bottom have been the biggest difference. Our old vacuum had the bristled roller on the bottom and wouldn't even rotate it was so tangled in hair. Now, hair isn't a problem. And the rubber rollers have enough give that when it starts to eat something like an iPhone charger, it just stops, and we can easily pull out whatever is caught (no damage to any items it's pulled in so far).When we first got it, we ran it several times in a row each ending with the ""full bin"" light. Definitely made me feel like we were missing a lot of the dust when we were vacuuming ourselves! Now we have it set to run every day, and it usually takes a few days to fill up the bin.It is a bit loud when it's in the same room you, but as soon as it rounds a corner you can barely hear it. We just set it to run when we're not home, so the noise isn't an issue. It gets over the raised edges in the doorways fine, and it'll go under our bed. If it's not in it's dock when we get home, it's usually pulled in something like a iPhone charger cord or cat toy. It would get confused more often when we first got it, but it seems to be a rare occurrence now.*Bonus*Our cats don't ride it, but they do follow it around. We turn it on when we're cooking and they'll be off following it instead of getting into the food."
5/27/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Our third child,"We purchased the new model mainly because it appeared to be a significant upgrade to their previous model (given price difference and technology), particularly in the pet hair department. We just upgraded our living quarters to a 3,400 square foot home with mostly dark wood floors, which we had no idea would show as much crap as they do at the end of a day. Our most recent vacuum was a Dyson pet model, which although has great pickup, is super stinky (again, years of pet hair) and, well, it's a push vacuum. We've moved the Dyson to the garage and literally only use it for cleaning vehicles and the garage floors.This Roomba has changed our cleaning lives. My husband is in charge of babysitting the Roomba, and he runs it every day in our main living/dining areas with wood floors, and every other day on carpeted bedrooms and tile bathrooms. It picks up pet hair, tiny cracker crumbs, cat litter that escapes the litter box, and even helps a bit with dirty paw/shoe smudges near exterior doors. Cleaning at baseboards/corners is excellent, and it is able to make it over our rugs. Requires a bit of babysitting as It gets stuck on a random sock or lost/stuck under furniture every so often but that's a minor inconvenience compared to the overall time and effort saved. We've had something block the interior once (probably a small kid toy) but it's easy to tell when he just isn't doing as good a job, and easy to open up to remove the blockage.It does seem to be growing 'smarter' after 2Ê months, navigating individual rooms faster than when we first let it loose. The ' virtual wall' units are easy to use -- just draw an imaginary line you don't want Roomba to cross, then face them toward each other across the room. Roomba will clean the space on one side of the line and will stop and turn off when he's done. Also various dings, songs, and calls out when needing a charge. Does sense stairs as promised, he hasn't had a tumble down ours to date.My only two beefs are not worthy of reducing stars: Obviously the dirt holder can't hold much debris/pet hair, so it does need to be emptied - but doing that takes as long as unraveling and plugging in a regular vacuum. Also, I find it loud enough to request it only run when I am not in the room (i.e., at night while we sleep or when we are out of the house); however, I am pretty sensitive to noise and my husband and kids don't have this issue.We were worried about its ability to navigate wood floors, as the website states very dark wood can confuse it. We haven't had a problem with this at all, and our floors are a deep brown, almost black. We ordered directly from iRobot as soon as it was released, so Amazon didn't have it yet. iRobot's website said 4-6 weeks but we received it in 1 week. Customer service told us to try it and could send it back for a full refund within 30 days if we weren't satisfied or it didn't work on our wood floors.Obviously I can't comment on longevity, but 2 months after we put it to use it's still going strong, and we really put it to the test with frequency of use and the debris (shedding dog and long haired cat). If you are debating over a new vacuum this one is SO WORTH THE MONEY if you value your time or have a huge space that shows dirt easily. If you're researching it you are willing (or almost willing) to spend this kind of money on a vacuum. From someone who had major reservations, I highly recommend buying it (with disclaimer of a short time of usage)."
7/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,A must if you have pets,"We purchased 2 Roomba! 1 for upstairs, other for downstairs.

11/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,and this one is like 10 times better,"We owned the first generation roomba red, and this one is like 10 times better. It does have some flaws. The charger wouldn't charge at the 4th month of purchase, chatted with customer service online and they sent us a new one. We liked it so much that we bought a 2nd one for upstairs. Now both of them has the same issue - the dust bin full red light won't go off, regardless the bin is full or not. Other than that, they are life savers."

9/25/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Worth the cost - Do it! You won't regret it.,"We love this! I know it's a lot of money and I struggled with spending that much but I now know it was WELL worth it. It runs everyday on our tile/carpet/area rug-covered floors. It works beautifully, getting into all those places the big vacuums can't go without moving furniture. Now dust and fur are no longer the downfall of owning a good sized home. I have a bad leg and I always avoided lugging around the big Dyson. This saves me time and pain. Plus, My animals who normally hate the vacuum are completely uninterested in this machine. Two days after I bought it, Amazon dropped the price by $70. I wrote to them and they refunded the difference. We're very, very happy!"

12/15/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Meet Tito, our new best friend.","We live in Florida and have 2 big dogs.Ê A golden and a lab. Lots of sand and dog hair.Ê Even still, I was really struggling with the investment of a robot vacuum.Ê I finally decided to buy the ""cheap"" one at 359.00It was the Roomba 650 and while it was ok, it just wasn't as smart as I thought it should be and a total PIA to clean.Ê Some friends have the 880 and swear by it.Ê I decided to bite the bullet and buy the 880 after I got a 20% off coupon from a retailer.Ê I'm so glad I did. It's well worth the extra money. The 880 is so much easier to clean, it has a lot more direction and even after a thorough vacuuming, it picked up still more dog hair. We have both tile, wood, and area rugs, it does great on all 3.Ê My tile is light and my rugs are dark brown with light colors and we have no sensor issues.Ê This little dude even went up on the edge of the door jam with the door open and hopped back down after cleaning it!I empty the cartridge after every cleaning, which doesn't bother me at all.I read a review about one spreading dog poop all around the house and getting inside the Roomba, which sounded so horrifying, I put the dogs on the patio and just hit the clean button when I take my son to school. We aren't very routined, so I don't have it on a schedule, but my friends do and that works great for them.Bottom line, it's expensive, even with 20% off, but worth every penny."
6/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Vinyl flooring, shag, and flat carpet","We live in a 102 year old farm house on a gravel road with 3 cats, 2 adults, and a newly crawling baby.Ê Cat hair and dirt/dust are serious problems here.Ê We have vinyl floor covering in the kitchen, a hideous shag/loop blend carpet in the living room, and flat, almost indoor/outdoor looking carpet upstairs in the bedrooms.Ê I dislike vacuuming, but the baby was getting almost as hairy as the cats and it was disgusting.Ê (He didn't mind, of course)Ê Fittingly enough, the Roomba arrived on May Day 2015 and saved my life.Ê Not literally of course, but WOW, has it ever saved me a lot of cleaning.Our house hasn't been updated since the 1960s/70s (we're working on it, but it's a slow process) and they used to heat the house with a woodstove in the kitchen.Ê That sticky soot stuck everywhere it touched - the walls are dingy, the floor is grimy, and even my carpet shampooer didn't take out the dingy stains. There was dust (older than me, probably) caked on the carpet along the edges of the walls.Ê No matter how diligent I was with the crevice tool and the regular vacuum, I just could not pry loose that sticky dust.Ê In less than a month, the Roomba had eliminated that nasty edge.Ê I don't know how it managed it; the rotating brush on the edge feels really soft, but it sure does a good job of beating out the dust in the places that a normal vacuum cleaner would miss.Pros:I don't have to vacuum, I just turn it on and walk away.It works while I play with the baby.The baby is fascinated by it.I've used it nearly daily for 6 weeks and I LOVE having clean floors with no work on my part.The cats are shedding like crazy right now, and still it manages to keep up.It has probably pulled a 5 gallon bucket worth of cat hair and dust out of our carpets in 6 weeks.Ê Seriously.Ê I can think it's clean but run the Roomba anyway, and it'll have nearly a full bin from just the kitchen & living room - probably around 700 sq ft.I've only taken it apart and cleaned the brushes once.Ê I have longish hair and there wasn't much wrapped up in the spindles, but it was really easy to pull out on this 880 version.Cons:It doesn't have great suction; it mostly relies on the brushes to float the debris into the dust receptacle.Ê Surface clean rather than deep clean.Ê Apparently I'm shallow, because I'm ecstatic with this surface clean!Dust bin is really small (After the first month, it can run more than once before the bin is full though)It has a ridiculously hard time finding its dock.Ê It has to be within about 18"" of it before it homes in on the infrared beam, apparently.The virtual walls/lighthouses don't always work.Ê Sometimes I come home to find it dead instead of docked.The first few days I had it, it got stuck under the bed and behind the couch several times.Ê You'll get to know where it should and shouldn't go.It was staggeringly expensive.Ê Probably worth it, as long as it lasts 5 years or so, but it was hard to commit to!You can't watch it work or it'll drive you nuts.Ê It's a totally random pattern.Ê It generally cleans the whole floor by the time it's done though.Overall, this is a wonderful product and I'm really glad I bought it!"
11/13/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,#NAME?,"We have used this robot vacuum cleaner for two months and compared it to the Roomba 650 and Miele Scout RX1.Cons:- It has problems entering carpets from hard surfaces. It seem to be a program error, resulting in parts of the room left from the cleaning process.- In some instances, it just stops when meeting steps instead of continuing- When docked, it usually makes an clicking sound. Placement in living room or bedroom is not possible, unless wanting to listen to this constant noise.- The charging process and battery life is unstablePros:- the design of the main brush is excellent if having pets as cats or dogs. Most robot vacuum cleaners have brushes getting filtered in hair, but the 880 avoids this due to the plastic tube used.- Efficient and rapid cleaning pattern- Low noise in example compared to the 650 model- Simple and easy programming- Lighthouse/area dividing system works well.We may have had bad luck with our unit, the best advice would be to buy this model in a store with good and reliable customer service as it may be needed."

We run this thing a few hours each day and now we vacuum manually maybe once a month...just to get behind and under things where it can't reach. Only drawbacks are that it fills up frequently so you have to empty it a lot, and it's a little noisy. Does its job very well, however (mostly tile floors, but it does get up on some pretty thick rugs that we have too without any trouble)."
12/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,great dogs but shedding machines,"We have two black Labradors, great dogs but shedding machines.Ê We were needing to clean the tile floors (2400 sq ft) every couple of days to control.Ê Had a chance to purchase a Miele Robotic cleaner for $99 (a savings of nearly $400) and decided to take a chance.Ê It is a little work horse but needs to be cleaned a couple of times each run.Ê It does about an 85-90% job.Ê We decided to step up to the Roomba 880 based on the great reviews we've read and thought that having two robotic cleaners might be the way to go.Ê For us, the Roomba 880 was worthless and we returned after a few days.What we liked about the Roomba 880:Ê it is a bit faster than the Miele and the electronic wall devices worked nicely to prevent it from areas where it might otherwise get into to trouble.Ê The Roomba came with two such devices and we could have used three more.What we DID NOT like about the Roomba 880:Ê Though faster it was louder, squealed at lot and drug fur more than it cleaned up the fur.Ê We have two area rugs (solid edges no fringes or loops).Ê The Roomba seemed to roll a lot of the fur into little 3 and 4 inch ropes and deposit them along the edgeswhere ever it climbed onto the area rug.Ê On the rugs it did not clean the fur but left lots of fur clumps all over the carpet.Ê Same happened on the tile floors in several areas.Ê It cleaned the tile floors better but still left those little fur ""ropes"" and clumps around.Ê The squealing was loud and irritating as it ran and we had to frequently stop the Roomba to clean fur from the wheels and brush to stop the squealing sound for a few minutes.Ê I tracked the Roomba for the first three days.Ê Its random movement seemed to miss some of our wide open floor spaces though it did a better job near the walls.Ê Too much work to keep it running, too little cleaning, too random and left too much fur on the floors.Ê Hands down, in our situation the Miele Robot (nearly the same cost as the Roomba) does a better job for us.Ê We really expected and wanted the Roomba to be our main robotic cleaner but we just had too many issues with it and were disappointed.Ê Thankfully, Amazon allowed us to return it for full refund."
2/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,SPOILED after only one week!!!!,"We have three dogs and three cats, all living indoors. One of our dogs is a humungous 115 pound mixed breed, year round, shedding machine.Ê Our backyard is nothing but dirt as the dogs have pretty much killed all of the grass.Ê Before I started working, it wasn't so bad as I would vacuum everyday or every other day.Ê Now, I work a part time job AND run a small business.Ê The last thing I feel like doing when I get home is vacuuming.Ê I considered a Roomba for a couple of years but the price kept me from buying one.Ê My business started picking up about six months ago, which gave me less time to do the vacuuming.Ê I finally got tired of hairballs all over the place and not being able to walk barefoot without having dirt and hair stick to my feet.Ê I debated for almost a month and finally decided to purchase the Roomba 880 with my Christmas money.Ê I bought it from Bed, Bath and Beyond and used a 20% off coupon, which made the purchase very sweet.Ê Mine came with two lighthouses and a remote control.Ê I have not set up the lighthouses as I'm not really sure I need them as our house is an open floor plan and ""Spencer"" (yes, I named him) seems to find his way around pretty well.Ê I have baby gates in the three bedrooms to keep the dogs out of them and so Spencer is responsible for cleaning approximately 1000 sq.ft of hard floor living space which includes, a huge living room, small kitchen / dining room, formal dining room, laundry room, hallway and bathroom.I vaccumed the floors with my Shark upright before I even ran Spencer the first time.Ê I was amazed that he still managed to pick up a canister full of fur and dirt even after I vacuumed with the upright.Ê I haven't set up Spencer's automatic timer because I prefer to wait until I get home to run him.....the last thing I want is for one of the dogs to get diarrhea or the cats to throw up while I am away and then come home to the stuff smeared all over the house.Ê Its not the quietest machine but it's not the noisiest either.Ê It doesn't bother me at all to have him running in the background while I am reading and responding to emails.Ê Spencer usually runs about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes everyday.Ê He goes in a zigzag pattern but somehow managers to cover all areas, spending additional time going back and forth on some areas before moving on.Ê I assume he feels these areas needs extra attention (near the backdoor and in front of the fireplace, where the dogs come and go and hang out most of the time).Ê I can finally walk barefoot in the house and the floor has NO grit, dirt or hair!!Ê He goes over the small throw rugs by the front and back doors easily but I have a memory foam rug in my bathroom that is kind of thick so when he comes to it, he bounces off it and goes in the other direction.Ê He also seems to go over electrical cords without any problems.Ê So far, he has not gotten stuck anywhere and he ALWAYS docks himself after his job is completed with a little tune of ""ta ta ta da!""Ê With the six mentioned pets, I DO have to empty the dust canister everyday.Ê I usually make this a part of my nightly routine when I give the dogs fresh water and snacks before bed and clean cat litter boxes.Ê Spencer is like one more little ""pet"" I have to tend to.....but a more helpful one than the other six I have!I'm not normally the type of person who goes nuts over a gadget, but I honestly can't imagine my life without Spencer in it.Ê If he ever breaks beyond repair, I will HAVE to buy another one."

05/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,The Clear Champion in Robotic Vacuums!,"We have had the Roomba 880 in our shopping list for some time.Ê Recently, it was priced down by $100 and we snapped at the opportunity to buy it.Ê We have not been disappointed!We have had four robotic vacuums from three different brands.Ê We have owned a iRobot Roomba 770 since November 2013 (you can see our review of that product elsewhere on Amazon).Ê We brought it with us from our rental apartment with dark hardwood floors and white carpets.Ê We have two cats, both of which shed significant amounts of hair.We now have a 3-storey townhouse.Ê The Roomba 880 lives on the open main floor (dining, family, kitchen, office) consisting of 1200 square feet of travertine tile floors with thin area rugs (no fringes) on pads.Ê It is programmed to clean four days a week.Ê The Roomba 770 is on the second floor (three bedrooms, two baths, long hallway) consisting of 1200 square feet of moderate depth cut pile carpeting.Ê That Roomba is programmed to clean on a M-W-F schedule.Ê We tried out a Canadian competitor, the Bobsweep Pethair on the 3rd floor (lounge room andÊ bath) consisting of 300 square feet of moderate depth cut pile carpeting.Ê Bobsweep was programmed to clean once a week.As other reviewers have noted, the Roombas are comparable in cleaning capabilities to other brands, although we give a slight edge to the Roombas, which seem to us to clean edges better.Ê The Roomba 880 is quieter than the Roomba 770 and the Neato we used to have.Ê Although other brands claim to do a more 'disciplined' job of cleaning since they plot the room and then navigate around in swaths rather than the random roaming about employed by the Roomba, at the end of the day, the Roomba does just as good a job.Ê Although the brush/roller on Neato products is significantly wider than the Roomba, surprisingly, that doesn't really seem to make a difference that we could tell.Our Roomba 770 is doing an admirable job on the 2nd floor, navigating through multiple rooms, under beds, around chairs and always returning to its base station without incident.Ê We tried running the Neato on the same floor and it utterly failed.Ê I would not even do a small area before complaining that the carpet was too thick.Ê The Neato got stuck sometimes under overhangs and in spots it got into but seems incapable of getting out of.A major failure of the Neato was that the battery seemed to be running out of capacity as it started cleaning part of the floor and then returned to its base station to recharge before completing the job.Our first choice is the Roomba 880, followed by the Roomba 770 and in last place by the Neato Botvac 80.Note, having a robotic vacuum (or more than one) does not mean you sit and drink iced tea and do nothing.Ê We clean ours after every cleaning cycle and check the rollers for string, yarn, hair, etc. wound around the rollers.Ê These should be cleaned thoroughly after every use in our application because of the copious amounts of hair from our cats that collects in the rollers.Ê The Neato is slightly easier to clean as the brush/roller does not seem to get clogged as much with cat hair.Ê Still, it is a small price to pay to have your house as clean as these keep it on a daily basis.Ê At this point, I am vacuuming the stairs once a month and doing periodic spot cleaning with the regular vacuum."
11/24/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great labor saver,"We have cats, and they shed like crazy [we're not sure how they still have hair ;) ]. The first few days the collection bin was full, but now I let this run every day and it goes about a week without having to empty the bin. It has not trouble with heat registers or throw rugs. If you don't like to vacuum, this is for you!"
06/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,She is amazing. She can pick stuff up even after using ...,We have been very surprised by how well our little helper works. We named her Eve. She is amazing. She can pick stuff up even after using our dyson. Best vacuum design for hair. It just rolls up on the end of the spindles allowing easy removal. We have her running every day. She definitely carries her weight.
8/21/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,An amazing tool,"We have been most pleased with the Roomba 880. She (the voice is female) cleans every room very well. We have three cats, and we have learned to run her three times a week. Even when the room looks clean to the eye, she gets an amazing amount of dust and dirt. We could not be happier. Obviously, she does not get above the floors, but even so, I notice less dust on the cabinets and above-the-floor items since we started using the Roomba 880. Yes, we do pick up chairs and furniture items that she could get hung up on. That takes far less time than vacuuming by hand - and I would have to do the same thing to properly vacuum by hand. The 880 comes with two ""wall/light house"" boxes and a remote. We have had to use the remote a few times when the Roomba got stuck under a furniture item, and it worked well. The ""virtual wall"" works very well. The ""lighthouse"" function not so well. We have learned to just keep the Roomba confined to one room or one area at a time. We have also learned to move the ""dock"" and allow the Roomba to start from the dock each time. That means for our house we move the dock three times each time we clean. It is no big deal, and it saves time and trouble in the long run. So, don't expect to be able to use the ""lighthouse"" to guide the Roomba back to its dock and let it clean the whole house. Technology doesn't appear to be there yet. But the little bit of trouble you take to move the Roomba and move the furniture pays off very nicely in a much cleaner home - and much less problems with dust and animal hair."
10/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,We have been amazed with how well the Roomba performs,"We have been amazed with how well the Roomba performs. We have three dogs but no more ""tumbleweeds"" of dog hair when we wake up."
4/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Better than expected!,"We have a single story house with a lot of hardwoods.Ê On top of that we have two dogs and two kids.Ê Therefore our hardwoods were constantly showing dust and fur.Ê We picked up the Roomba to run between sweepings to help get the dust and fur under control and keep the hardwoods looking clean.Ê The Roomba has excelled at this.Ê We use the virtual walls / lighthouse to have it focus on the foyer / great room every day.Ê Our hardwoods show very little dust and stay clean.In addition to the daily hardwoods, we run the Roomba in various rooms throughout the week.Ê For example, if we are outside with the kids I will put the Roomba in our master bedroom and let it run.Ê Doing this helps keep the carpets looking nice.Ê We were also pleasantly surprised how well it goes under couches and beds cleaning places our normal vacuum cannot reach.The Roomba is also well thought out and engineered.Ê I took the AeroForce Extractors out to clean them and they will only go backÊ in one way making it impossible to put them in wrong.Ê Our daughter spilled some honey on the floor that we missed and got all over the Roomba's edge cleaning brush.Ê It was very easy to swap this out for a new one.The Roomba is expensive.Ê For that money you get something that cleans great, provides flexibility in cleaning, and is well engineered."
9/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,LOVE IT,We have a lovely dog and a 7 months baby girl. I was troubled with so much pet hair all over and even cleaning everyday didnt make the job. We purchase the Roomba in hope for a fix and it did it. Scheduled to vacuum every other day the robot proven to be the best solution.Thank you.
4/18/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,This thing is absolutely worth it!,"We have a lot of hardwood flooring, tend to have the windows open, and therefore tended to have a lot of dust (pollen, who knows what?) on the floors, especially evident in afternoon light. No more! When the afternoon sun hits, all we have is shiny floors.My take was that this is a gadget that might be useful, but was really pricy.Ê Some reviews of earlier models raised concerns about falling down stairs, eating cords and rug fringe, etc. However, tired of vacuuming three or more times a week, (even with a Miele), and fighting seasonal allergies it seemed worth a try.Wombot's first outing was in the living room cleared of all cords and other possible indigestibles.Ê It spent 45 minutes (and I think I heard tsk tsk from a neglected corner) and left the room spotless, including baseboards, chair and table legs, and everything it could navigate under or around.Ê Small area rugs were no problem. Now it takes about 20 minutes to clean the same space and this week had no trouble spitting out a cord that I forgot to move off of the floor.Ê It always pulls back from the stairs on its own, so I can leave it alone to do the hallways.Ê The gizmos that let you ""block"" off areas work really well.We have a three story house and it is no trouble to move it from floor to floor and return it to the level with its docking station. It sails under beds, desks, etc., although you want to be sure bedclothes and curtains are not trailing on the ground. The bin is easy to empty, and it reminds you when it is full.It docks near the kitchen, and what a wonderful convenience to easily turn it loose in there when a few coffee grounds have gone astray, or we have been baking and some flour has inevitably drifted on to the floor. It is really good at working along the baseboards and the base of the appliances, as well as the middle of the floor.In terms of noise, I run it in my office when I am working and am only distracted when it tries to clean my feet and I have to lift them off the floor briefly.Ê It is certainly quieter than a regular vac."
09/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Roomba 880 keeps routine house chores in check!,We have a large 4400 sq ft home.Ê Roomba 880s'work every day..Ê They can't always find their base stations however they clean remarkably well.Ê Wife said it was expensive but it was well worth it!!!
5/13/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great for long hair dogs,We have a heavy coated Golden Retriever and was pleasantly surprised how much superior this model is compared to other for picking up dog hair and how easy it is to maintain.
9/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,A lot better for pets.,"We have a 300 series Roomba in addition to this 880 series Roomba.Ê We were initially gifted a refurbished 300 series and it worked very well until we got a puppy.Ê Once the puppy started to shed, in combination with my wife's long hair, the 300 series got to the point that after every use the whole brush assembly needed to be taken apart to remove the hair from the brushes and the gears hidden behind the plastic.Ê That is why we got the 880 Roomba.Ê Since switching out the Roombas, it takes 20 seconds twice a week to pull a very small amount of hair off the brushes and it is back ready to go.Ê It's not cheap, but if you want your house vacuumed once a day every day and you have pets, it's worth the extra money compared to one of the older series."
09/12/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,Terrible disappointing 880 roomba,"We had a previous roomba for four years, never a problem. I have just returned my third 880 roomba after multiple problems. Wow how disappointing. It would stop, wouldn't charge, couldn't dock, terrible noise and grinding sound.Customer support is terrific but what a mess this has been. 4th time better be a charm or we will ask for our money back and try another type."
8/13/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Picks up much more than my previous Roomba 572 Pet Series,"We had a gift certificate to use up so we ""upgraded"" a 3-year old Roomba 572 Pet Series used in our bedroom.Ê We have 2 dogs and It's great how the Roomba can clean under the bed.Ê First off, the new 880 runs much quieter than the 572 or even another 780 we run downstairs at night.Ê But what really surprised me over the past few weeks is how much we still find in the new 880's pickup bin.Ê Since the 572 was previously running daily and wasn't picking up that much, the new 880 is clearly much more thorough.Ê Great job Roomba!"
7/14/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,My new companion,"We got the Roomba 880 to help clean up the food and hair mess constantly regenerating from our two cats (okay, we also make a mess, especially in the kitchen.) While I am thrilled with the superb job it does at vacuuming, in an unexpended turn, I find myself addressing it as if it is another pet or person in the house. The cats are definitely jealous and I only hope my husband doesn't follow suit.Some notes after a couple months of adopting Roomba:1. It makes a ticking noise while on the charger that really gets on my nerves so I moved it to a less used part of the house.2. It gets full very quickly when it vacuums our rugs.One major thing that would make Roomba better is wifi capability and an app to control it. Who uses a remote to control their robots these days?"
11/15/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Zoila (that's what we call our iRobot) has died.,"We got ours right when they came out and ordered it direct from iRobot.com. Today it's 7 months since we first got the 880 and it's died. Will not light up, won't charge, nothing. I just spent about 30 minutes chatting with iRobot to get a replacement product. They are sending us a new robot, because we're within the warranty. Makes us nervous that such an expensive product would just up and die randomly like this after only 7 months' time. A little worried---"
06/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,but it's really easy to use and it clean really good,"we got 2 dogs and 2 cats, one long hair dog and one poodle, my poodle are ok cause he doesn't lose hair, omg with one white long hair dog and one white cat and one black cat, there are hairs everywhere on my floor. so cleaning my hardwood floor become a daily thing, this vacuum helps a lot, i almost gonna get two, one for downstair and one for upstair, but it is kind of expensive, but it's really easy to use and it clean really good, of cause it will not get every spot in the house, but it did really good job clean the hair on the floor and dust too. i wish it has bigger battery and quiet sound, but those are not big problem at all, still a really good vacuum. just schedule when you want it to work and clean the box when you get home. make my life so much easier."

06/08/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Fantastic for reducing allergies, may make you a neat freak!","We bought this Roomba 880 robot vacuum cleaner to help clean our family vacation apartment. The apartment is only about 700 sq feet and is occupied for about 3-4 months of the year, so lots of dust accumulates between visits. I have a very severe dust mite allergy, and I usually sneeze for most of the time we are in the apartment, even if we damp dust and HEPA vacuum it with our Dyson canister vacuum cleaner soon after we arrive. I was very curious (and skeptical) to see whether Minnie (our Roomba) could alleviate these symptoms and reduce our cleaning workload while on vacation.The apartment has mixed surfaces. About two thirds of it is tiled and the rest is carpet, including the bedrooms. The floor plan is fairly open, except that the 2 bedrooms and bathrooms are separate along a corridor. This is important when considering how to use the robot most efficiently. Now that we have had Minnie for around a month, I have to say that she (has to be a she - the error messages are all given by a female voice!) does a superb job. My husband is an efficient demon with the Dyson, doing a VERY thorough job. However, he insists that Minnie does a better job than he can. My allergies have improved hugely. So much so, that we are going to have to buy a second Roomba for our home.Now for some nitty gritty:Pros1. Does a fantastic job, probably better than most humans2. Happily goes under beds, eliminating those dust bunnies which make me sneeze all night3. Very easy to use4. Very easy to empty the bin and clean the filter - takes about 2 minutes, maximum. Good idea to clean the HEPA filter with a handheld vacuum like the Dyson models, to prolong filter life5. Virtual wall lighthouses work very well, once you understand their intricacies6. Can be left unattended or scheduled to clean while you are away, once you have Roomba-prepped the area to be cleaned7. Massively reduces the dust load in a home, far more than human vacuuming can reasonably do. Be aware that the first few times in a carpeted room, you may need to empty the bin every 15 mins or so. It really is that good at picking up dust. Be prepared to babysit the robot constantly at first!8. Much quieter than a standard manual HEPA vacuum, but don't expect to be able to hold a telephone conversation with someone on a bad cellphone connection when you are 3 yards away from it9. Decent battery life. Probably about 3.5 hours on our machine. We can now clean the whole apartment in less than 2 hours - no need to recharge. However the first few cleanings, particularly on carpet areas, took much longer than this, and required an overnight charge to finish.10. I have long hair - about 4 inches below the shoulder. Minnie picks it all up, even from carpet. It can wrap around the rollers, but simply removing the rollers and tugging on the hair pulls most of it away in one neat coil. Much easier than brush vacuum cleaners!Cons (most of these are minor design niggles, and I have tried to suggest a way to work with them)1. Instruction manual leaves a lot to be desired. It is fairly brief, and tells you most of the essentials, but it doesn't help you to understand how to use your Roomba most effectively. The iRobot web site doesn't fill in the gaps. You either have to learn from experience, or Google and hope that you find the answer2. Some of the information in the manual is misleading. For example, the cleaning patterns illustrated are not how the 880 works. If you start cleaning from the Home Base, the Roomba does a sort of random straight line scribble over the whole room, not a spiral and straight edge clean as displayed in the manual. It will pay special attention to edges, but the cleaning pattern is not as illustrated. I am certain that many engineers who own Roombas may be on the verge of a nervous breakdown if they watch this apparently random pattern. Having said that, our Minnie does pick up >99% of ""bits"" that I have noticed before starting her. This includes bread crumbs, hairs, lint, onion and garlic papery skins, grit from drilling the wall, etc. Just be patient and don't obsessively watch - she will get it.3. Virtual wall light houses are essential for an efficient clean, and their use is very poorly described in the manual. From a combination of experience and reading, I have come up with the following:a) Virtual wall lighthouses (VWLH) supplied with the 880 (2 of them) can be used to divide up a complex shaped area to clean it more efficiently. When you start Roomba, it counts how many VWLH are present (seems like it may only be able to count to 3 though!), then immediately starts cleaning the starting area where you first pressed the Clean button. All of the VWLH devices go into Virtual Wall mode at this point, penning the Roomba into the area you designated. According to iRobot.com, the Roomba will clean that first area until it is clean, or for a maximum of 25 mins. With Minnie, this is NOT true. For the first few uses, she would clean an area for over 45 mins, so the online info is not necessarily accurate. Once Roomba has finished the first area, the closest VWLH will then go into ""lighthouse"" mode, allowing Roomba to cross into the next area. Once she has passed into that area, it becomes a virtual wall again, keeping her in the new zone until Roomba has finished cleaning it. It then reverts to lighthouse mode, allowing the robot to exit the area and proceed to the next area protected by a VWLH, if any. This process is repeated until the segregated zones are cleaned, at which point the Roomba returns to its home base.b) Light house placement is somewhat critical. The VWLH and the Home Base both emit a kind of ""halo"" of a no-go zone around themselves, so that the robot can't nudge them out of position. It seems to be about 8-10 inches in radius. This means that you must not place the home base too close to a doorway where you intend to use a VWLH, or the two will interfere, and the robot may not clean the room. We have found that the best placement is on the far side of a threshold, behind, but level with the door frame. Experience will teach you what works best for you.c) If you are cleaning a narrow hallway, do not put the home base on one of the long walls, as the robot may get confused and stay down one end of the hall for much of the cleaning cycle (yes, I have done this). The halo effect can block a lot of the corridor and make it hard for Roomba to navigate along it past the home base or VWLH. You will know this is happening if Roomba keeps pirouetting on the spot before moving on to an area it has already cleaned. Happens with VWLHs as well as Home base - so place them both thoughtfully!4. Blinking lights are not well explained. For example:a) A blue starfish light on top of Roomba means that the side brush is slowing down. If the robot is on a deep pile carpet, it may just be friction from that. If not, you need to stop it and untangle any accumulated crud from the side brush under the robotb) A flashing blue magnifying glass usually means that Roomba has detected extra dirt. This light will usually change to the signal described in c), but if it doesn't you may need to clean the counter-rotating rubber rollers as described in the manual, and wipe out the channel under those (when the machine is upside down) to the collector bin. The dirt detector in the 880 is an optical sensor (not acoustic as in older models) above the rollers in the channel to the bin - if it gets very dirty, it can give false signals.c) A solid blue magnifying glass means that Roomba is in intensive clean mode. Now this gets confusing... If it goes into this mode itself, it will do a fan-shaped back and forth motion over about a 1 yard area. If it is showing this icon after you pressed the Spot clean button, it will spiral over about the same area, unless it hits something, at which point it will go back to normal cleaning mode. Don't stress, it is cleaning!Ê :)5. We have never heard a full bin warning. It would be helpful if it was either used, or nice and loud! The machine does not stop cleaning when the bin is full, so you may want to clean again if you find it with a full bin, as it is obviously not very"
9/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"A Beast Of Burden, Not A Toy","We bought this new 880 made specifically for pets and allergies. The purchase severely hurt the budget, but the return is bringing comfort to an allergic household member that is not physically capable of vacuuming. I had no idea of the importance of vacuuming until this highly sensitive individual joined our home; it simply has to be done daily. My spouse and I have done a good job of staying on top of it, but we've each had our misses and realized we needed a contingency plan; I recalled seeing a Roomba at someone's home and decided it could be the solution. Having a home with tile, hardwood and carpeted floors, my expectations were that we'd have to limit the Roomba to one area at a time. As it turns out, it's not necessary, the Roomba moves seamlessly from one floor surface to another. In an area with a thick rug on top of hardwood, it's usually a matter of it just rolling on and off, but I have seen it take two attempts. On tile and hardwood, I think the Roomba works better than any vacuum we've had. I deliberately set the Roomba to vacuum the kitchen's tiled floor immediately after using a Dyson Animal. Considering the floor had just been vacuumed, the amount the Roomba picked up was amazing. We've been playing with configuring the two included ""lighthouses"" to effectively guide the Roomba room to room, but I think it's going to require manual intervention to completely work. We're currently running the Roomba on a nightly schedule in the open plan area of the house. By the time I wake up, it has run its course and recharged. In the morning I empty the bin and carry the Roomba (handy carrying handle) to a different room and let it clean until it stops. The first few times, before letting it roll free, I'd forget to scan for obstacles. After a few loud incidents, it's become habit to remove or raise all that I can (chairs and trash cans on to tables and desk; shoes, dog bed and toys to closet; floor fan set outside of door, etc). In the short month we've had it, I love it. If my opinion changes, I'll update here, but right now I highly recommend."
9/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,It seems to do a great job of picking up pet (and human) hair off ...,"We bought this after installing hardwood and laminate flooring throughout our house.Ê It seems to do a great job of picking up pet (and human) hair off the floor.Ê We still go over some areas with a wet mop (Bona or other appropriate cleaner) to get rid of spots.Ê But it's really a treat to know that a lot of stuff was picked up by the Roomba.One note - you MUST stay on top of emptying the canister & removing hair from the rollers and edging sweeper.Ê If you don't, they'll clog up just like any other vacuum cleaner.Ê Read the directions on that and do it regularly."
4/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,The Robot Takes Up Residence After Passing Its Audition,"We bought this a few weeks ago and love it.Ê In fact my wife only allowed the purchase if it could be returned to the retailer in case she didn't like it.Ê It has not gone back because in our scenario it is doing a better job than our traditional Dyson vacuum.I was initially concerned about the size of the dust bin but that was much better than I expected, especially after the 880 had cleaned the house a couple of times after I had already vacuumed the house.Ê It really does a very good job of getting dirt that the vacuum doesn't get, perhaps because our house has 100% ceramic tile and the AeroForce Extractors make physical contact with the floor instead of the vacuum passing just above the floor.The 880 has exceeded expectations, even considering the price paid for it.Ê It really does cover the entire area to be cleaned and has yet failed to return to its dock at the end of a cycle.Ê If you manually tell it to dock it will still take a few minutes to do that so expect that behavior.My one wish is that the Schedule function had a method for telling the robot to put schedules on vacation with one or two commands.Ê Currently you need to reschedule each day to turn that off and a single command would avoid that and then re-establishing the schedule once you were back from vacation."
12/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Better than we expected,"We bought our Roomba 880 during the thanksgiving weekend sale. I was pretty skeptical buying this product but my wife was adamant in buying it (even thou I vacuum the house :) ). It has been working well for the last month or so. We use it to vacuum our 1800 sqft house every week (I do have to carry it around since we have step downs at 2 places).The roomba does a very good job in picking up the dirt. We were really amazed the amount of dust we find in the compartment after every clean. The 1st time we vacuumed our bedroom (which is carpet but rest of the house is hardwood), we were surprised to see the dust collector compartment full before it finished its full course (I had vacuumed our room the week before). Overall it is been doing a really good job. I haven't necessarily see any scratches on our hardwood floors (entire house is hardwood and 1 room is carpet) yet as 1 of the reviewers mentioned. The lighthouse seems to be working fine.Like any product, it has some drawbacks. It is LOUD. It does randomly go around the same place many number of times. But a chat with the representative revealed that it will be vacuuming the place for an hour at least before it goes to its docking station. It does error out (I guess error 6) when it recognises a staircase at which time one has to move the roomba before it can continue (has happened like 5-6 times till date). It does NOT recognize the furniture legs, it does go and bang into the legs but it does well when nearing a wall.Ê I have also seen at times that it struggles to go back to its docking station the 1st time. It moves the docking station and comes out of the station but eventually goes and sits in place.Overall a very good product. Pretty happy with it!!!"
11/24/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,A few brief points.,"We bought our Roomba 880 back in August and we really love it. I would say the single best thing about it, other than the obvious of it doing most of the work, is that it fits under all of our sofas, coffee tables, dressers, etc. It simply cleans more places and more thoroughly than we used to. Many others have written great reviews on what to expect, how to use it well, etc., so I just wanted to add a few notes.1. Others have said that it really does stop at the tops of stairs, but that is not our experience. I can't express just how distressing it is to hear your very expensive robotic vacuum bouncing down an entire flight of (luckily, carpeted) stairs. I am somewhat disappointed that it didn't vacuum the stairs on the way down!2. This thing is rugged! After #1 above, I thought it would be in pieces. Not only was it sitting at the bottom of the stairs in one piece, after bringing it back upstairs, I pressed the button and it took off like nothing had happened. I bought another lighthouse for the top of the stairs, though. Two isn't enough if I also have to also block the stairs.3. It does fine over bathroom rugs and short-napped room rugs, but don't expect it to handle a shag-style area rug. We bought one after having the Roomba and it could neither get up onto it nor run on it if we lifted a Roomba onto it. Naturally, we returned the rug!4. It does get stuck sometimes, but that really just means you shouldn't necessarily expect it to start up when you're not home and finish without you. You soon learn where it gets stuck, though, and if you can't block it with a lighthouse, you just learn to listen for the cry for help. No big deal, really, next to the time it takes to vacuum the old fashioned way.Overall, I am very happy with the Roomba 880 and I highly recommend it. If I were buying it today, I might spring for the new 980 that maps the house. I know that iRobot says their algorithm makes sure the entire room is covered with the 880, but I would feel better knowing that the robot knew the room and tracked it's coverage deliberately.

I purchased this to replace my bristle one because I got tired of cleaning the dog hair out of the brushes!! Works perfectly and I no longer see dust bunnies or dog hair piles under my living room chairs. Easy to program.

06/06/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Go for it!,"Was always curious about robotic vacuums. After reading reviews and performance tests of the newest 800 series Roomba, I decided to pull the trigger. Very easy to set up and program. Does require frequent maintenance, but it's quick and easy. The first few runs, it filled up quickly (I can't believe how much my upright left behind!), but has required less frequent emptying as time goes on. It goes completely under the bed. Something I couldn't do before. I don't have pets so i can't say how well it handles pet hair. It will pick up my girlfriend's hair and I will have to cut that out of the rollers. Literally takes 5 seconds. You will have to observe it's behavior/abilities and address any areas it has trouble with. It is relatively loud if it's in the same room with you. I have mine scheduled to run 5 days a week while we're out at work. I must say it is nice to come home to a freshly vacuumed home everyday. Additionally, it promotes a cleaner house overall because things have to be picked up off the floor and cords tucked away so it can run it's course without getting hung up. It does bump into things a little harder than I am comfortable with, so I will be adding an adhesive foam strip to it soon. The included (2) lighthouses/virtual walls work as they're supposed to. It's not perfect, but it does what it was designed to do very well. You will still need to vacuum in corners and areas that it can't get into, so it's not a total upright replacement. It does, however, always have dust in it's bin so it's definitely working. If you can get over the initial cost, it will keep on giving back. I'm so happy with mine, I'm considering the Scuuba mop robot (but that hasn't reviewed as well). No regrets with this purchase. Absolutely recommend!"
3/30/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Do Vacuum Robots Dream of Electric Sheep? I don't know, but this thing cleans","Wanted to wait a few months before writing this review.Ê This is well worth the money. This is also not like the first few Roomba's iRobot came out with... this one actually works.Ê I never thought it would be such a time saver and relief for the tedium of household chores. At first, it seems like you're getting a really expensive vacuum with less ""bag"" space and a seemingly stupid methodology for cleaning.Ê I had that same thought, but you quickly realize how much time you will free-up with one of these and how much cleaning it actually does - I also bought an iRobot Bravaa to mop floors.Ê The Roomba doesn't get really deep into carpets like a good vacuum, but it maintains your cleaning job much longer and on hard floors it picks-up every little piece of free dirt and dust.Ê You're going to want to run it everyday but maintain some semblance of traditional cleaning.Ê So I still have our vacuum, but where you would need to vacuum maybe 2-3 times per week, now only once per week or less - we have pets so carpets especially need more cleaning.Ê We rarely, if ever need to vacuum our hard flooring.Ê You can set it on a timer for every day of the week.Ê It runs around the house, cleaning while you're out.Ê Sometimes it can't find the dock or doesn't hit a room we want it to (We bought the one with 2x lighthouse/virtual walls to expand the cleaning area and I wished the instructions were a little clearer on how to make this work seemlessly.Ê I've tried many different arrangements and it doesn't seem to always route successfully).Ê That's ok though, because when you notice it hasn't been in a room or area you want it to clean, you just pick the Roomba up and put it in the room and hit the clean button.Ê I find myself just putting this guy wherever something seems a little dusty.Ê By the time it finishes its cycle, the floor is 95-100% clean.Ê Anything it missed, you can re-orient it to that spot and hit the ""Spot"" clean button.Ê That's it.Ê It's simple and effective.Ê The charge lasts for several cleanings in one day, and if near the docking station, it will go back to its charger by itself."

The last few weeks, it's dropping a wheel off the edge to the stairs, thus unable to maneuver out. I have cleaned the sensors. I have not called customer service.It will maneuver behind the sofas and out the way it came in.Dirt bin is small but as long as it is run (and emptied) daily, it seems sufficient.It does pick up medium size dog kibble and bird feathers.A hairspray cap got stuck between the pick up wheels and wore a bald pattern so I needed to replace those (easy peasy).I like how each day can have its own programmed start time.It is about as loud as a normal vacuum."

07/03/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Roomba 880 vs. Neato XV Signature Pro,"Two years ago I purchased a Neato XV Signature. It did a great job. But last month the its LCD panel died. I gather it's a known problem solved only by buying parts on Ebay and undoing a million screws, including two crucial ones hidden behind white tape. Irritated by the whole situation, I was ready for something new. So, bolstered by the excellent reviews of the Roomba 880, I decided to give it a try. It proved to be a mistake.Navigation. I knew before buying the Roomba that it employed a very different algorithm than the Neato. The Neato sizes up a room, cleans the perimeter, mows it efficiently, and returns to its starting point. The Roomba leaves its dock with the enthusiasm of an anxious but blind roadrunner. It ricochets off walls and furniture, apparently relying on Chaos Theory to ensure thorough coverage. While the Roomba moves faster than the Neato, it takes longer for it to clean the same square footage because it doesn't care if it goes over and over the same area, whether that area needs cleaning or not. Often I find the Roomba in the middle of a hallway turning in tight circles for no apparent reason. Despite, or perhaps because of, its lower profile, the Roomba also seems to get caught beneath cabinets more than the Neato.Docking: The Neato rarely had issues finding its way back to its dock. I put the Roomba's dock in the same spot as the Neato's, and the Roomba can rarely find its way home. I had to pick another less-convenient docking spot for the Roomba to give it any shot at all. Oddly, the Roomba doesn't seem to like its dock very much. Often the first thing it does during a scheduled cleaning cycle is to crash violently into its own dock, knocking it sideways and making it impossible for docking without human intervention.Lighthouses and virtual walls. The Roomba relies on little battery powered towers to help guide it around the house. The virtual wall function of these devices works well. Too bad you only get two of these useful devices in the box. You can order a third one for $35 or so, but there's no point getting a fourth since the Roomba can't cope with more than three at a time. For houses with complex floor plans or with floor cables that need protection, this is a bad limitation. Honestly, I never could get the hang of the Lighthouse feature. It just didn't seem to help the Roomba navigate more efficiently. All this is in contrast to the Neato, which uses black magnetic floor strips to block the robot from entering certain areas. These strips can be placed as needed and without limitation. They require no batteries and work flawlessly. The Neato doesn't require any lighthouse help: it methodically cleans using on-board laser-guided navigation.Cleaning. The Roomba has a blue LED on top that illuminates when it senses particulate matter requiring extra attention. The theory and the light are fine, but I wasn't convinced that the light came on in especially dirty areas, or went off when those areas were.clean. Sometimes the Roomba would move away from an area while the blue light remained on, as if it conceded that this blue-light area (which was perfectly clean) was just too demanding to clean. The Roomba comes with a small spinning side brush intended to clean dust along the baseboard. Since new Neatos have adopted this feature, I guess its a positive feature. But that doesn't make up for the round shape of the Roomba, which prevents it from getting into corners very effectively. The D-shape of the Neato, and the fact that its rollers are wider, make it superior in the corners, with or without a spinning side brush.Noise. The devices are equally noisy, despite the Neato's more powerful motor. Neither machine generate as much noise as our upright.Dirt cup. The Roomba's dirt cup is considerably smaller than the Neato's. Guess this makes sense since the Roomba picks up less dirt. It's easier to empty the Neato's cup too; you pop off the filter and tap the cup and filter over a garbage can in one motion. The Roomba's dirt cupÊ demands that you open its narrow side door. You can tap the container too, of course, but I find that I often had to dig cat fur and such out with my fingers. And then the cleaning isn't done: I also have to open a separate hatch to get to the filter. Cleaning the Roomba's dirt cup and filter isn't hard; it just takes 30 seconds longer and is a bit messier.Remote control. Consumer Reports downgraded the Neato for its lack of a remote control. The Roomba has one, but I can't figure out why anyone would use it. I mean, isn't the idea to set the robo-vacuum and forget it? Who wants to bother directing a Roomba around the house?Ê Might be fun for three minute or so, but then what? The Roomba is not some radio-controlled hot rod; it moves like a staggering drunk when attempting to obey remote commands.Scheduling: Both devices can be scheduled without much effort. It's easier and nicer to do on the Roomba, however, since it has some excellent buttons for this purpose.Cat response. Our three cats view both the Roomba and the Neato as mildly annoying, but harmless, No cat seems to want to follow them around or ride them."

Horrible experience with both product quality as well as customer services. I brought the 880 on Amazon and first time to use it was 4 months later in another country. However, after 4 times use for cleaning rooms. It stopped recharge the battery and machine just went died. I tried to contact local iRobot customer support but they mentioned that your item is not supported since your brought it from US. And I contacted customer support in US, they wrote back that you need to find local customer support. I don't mind that I had back luck got a low quality machine but I do mind that their customer service for not doing their work. I went to iRobot website and read their warranty terms which I should go through before placed the order. It is not a good product warranty. So I would say I will take my lesson with $699.99 for cleaning my room for 4 times : )I will not recommend people who read my review to buy iRobot products with following customer profile:1. You are planning to buy iRobot product in US and use it in other countries. You will not get proper customer services;2. You mind quality of any electronic product and don't want to a lucky draw with $700;3. You think customer should get good service and care.At the end, 880 did clean my room, with $175 each time : p"

6/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,My newest BFF,"This was my birthday gift from my husband this year. He couldn't believe I wanted a vacuum cleaner. This is so much more, I really really love it. We don't have pets but we have wool rugs that shed worse than ten cats! The first time I used it on the rugs I had to empty it three times before it finished. Now I let it loose twice a week and the wool hair is now under control. It is well worth the money. The instructions are easy to follow. At first it seems to run in random patterns but after it runs around your house a few times it seems to learn patterns to follow. I did not know it had a ""voice"" and the first time it ""spoke"" It really startled me."
8/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,New Age Vacuuming,"This was a pleasant surprise. This little gadget will vacuum close to the floor so it's relatively quiet. It doesn't need a jet engine to elevate debris into a canister. It zips under furniture I had trouble forcing my vacuum head and wand under, and no more getting on my knees to do it! I did vacuum my carpets before, but the first time I used this I thought my new calling in life was to empty the little dust bucket. It let me know how much dust I was missing. After using it the first couple times I noticed my carpet was actually brighter, and I only had to empty the dust bin, perhaps once. I let it vacuum for well over an hour. I was usually sick of myself vacuuming well before that (I have a small house). If you set up the virtual walls or close doors to keep it in an area you can leave to do something else, the same as you would with a laundry or dishwashing machine. It won't do stairs and you need to be aware of things to help it, like moving furniture and capturing wires etc."

It really stuffs the pet hair into the tiny compartment until none can be stuffed in anymore so you are not having to clean it every few minutes. I keep a pair of needle nose pliers handy to pull the hair out, as well as a can of compressed air to thoroughly clean out the collection area. We have a two-story house so it gets shifted from one floor to another. The dogs got used to it pretty quickly. Now, one pays so little attention to it, it runs into her and she doesn't even care."
11/25/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Fantastic,"This vacuum is so helpful for people who are gone all the time and too busy.I have a regular vac also and I admit my Roomba does a better job than I do! (that is so sad...)My complaint is that corners aren't really dealt with and sometimes it will get stuck on things and die when you're not home. Also it seems to go over the same places a billion times when you want it to go do another spot. So sometimes by the time its running out of steam and will dock itself to recharge, it hasn't cleaned the whole room. So that can be frustrating.Other than that though, this has been a serious blessing for me because I am too busy and its refreshing to come home knowing that there's less dust on the floor which helps SO much with allergies.My apartment is 400 square feet of hard floor and it does die a fair amount so I would question it's ability in a large home."

It works extremely well, picking up a ton of dust, cat hair, litter, dirt. It cleans close to the walls/cupboards and even can clean between all the dining room chairs. It also cleans rugs well. The filter is easy to empty. I have a physical injury that makes vacuuming with a standard vacuum very difficult, so this has made it much easier to keep the house clean! Highly recommend."
12/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I love my robot minion,This vacuum does everything as described. It incredibly useful to the point of being indispensable. I'm only upset that I didn't buy this thing sooner.
01/03/2016,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great cleaning unit!,"This vac really works well.Ê I was a bit skeptical, thinking this wouldn't do the job of an upright vac, but it has amazed both me and my wife.Ê What a wonderful unit.Ê Frees us up to do other things while it does the cleaning!"
7/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,This unit is the perfect partner to help keep the pet dander and pet ...,This unit is the perfect partner to help keep the pet dander and pet hair cleaned up.Ê We have two labrador dogs and needed the help.Ê It serves us well and is well worth the money.
02/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,#NAME?,"This unit (I purchased from Bed Bath and Beyond via a 20% off coupon) has a challenging time navigating my floor plan.Ê It's not a complicated perimeter but there are a few chairs, sofa, coffee table in near proximity to each other and the Roomba will regularly get lost or stuck under one of the mentioned items.Ê I've reverted back to using a broom and a regular vacuum cleaner, overall time to clean is less than using Roomba which I constantly have to get back on track.Ê -- Bought a Dyson Animal and really like it."
7/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,This thing works great..,This thing works great...Ê I had one of the original units from many years ago and it worked fine....Ê But this new version works amazingly well...Ê No more cutting hair from the rollers and it's suction is great...Ê Leaves the floors very clean.
9/26/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,in a good way!,This thing will change your life....in a good way!
09/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,fun to watch and try and figure out what it's ...,"This thing rocks. fun to watch and try and figure out what it's thinking.Ê the remote control sucks. its to hard to control with any precision. it does a great job cleaning. gets stuck on towels and clothes so I have to pick that stuff up, it makes me be less of a slob.Ê The price is too high, wait for the 15% sales before purchasing."
09/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Very good at new carpet fibers,This thing rocks!Ê It picked up a ton of fine carpet fibres that managed to escape regular vacuuming missed.
05/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,This thing is the greatest thing ever invented,"This thing is the greatest thing ever invented! I'm so happy with it. I have had it for about 2 months or so. I have two cats (persians really furry and sheddy). I shake out hair balls the size of my fist from the trash tray. Great for people with animals that shed a great deal. I rarely ever sweep, and when I do I turn it on and let it run while I sweep behind and under areas the roomba can not reach and it just sucks it up with very little effort on my part. To be fair we do have a very small living area, but it is perfect for people on the go or college students that don't have literally any time to spare cleaning. I was sweeping 2-3 times a days due to the cat and dog fur, and my bf says he's never seen the floors cleaner. Initially I was running it twice a day, and now I'm done to once a day 7 days a week. I also was hesitant to buy it after reading the few bad reviews, and just took the leap of faith and so glad I did.Ê Best money I ever spent. I work, intern, and go to school and this saves me time and lessens my stress about the dirt on the floors (because I'm a clean freak). I can walk on my tile floors barefoot and it feels like I had them professionally cleaned. I will say that I have a small shaggy carpet that I just pick up and shake because it does not do that great on that particular carpet type, but if you have tile this is freaking amazing!!! You will also waste a lot of time staring at it do its work because it's just simply cool and fun to watch. I really want to try the scooba roomba now.... but i'll have to wait on that a bit and see how it pans out review wise and with technology updates before I just to invest in it. I will say that I will be a Roomba follower now and in the future."
8/28/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Love it!,"This thing is great. My house is all wood and tile floors, which seem to get dirty as soon as I vacuum. The roomba was up & running within 5 min of arriving. It's pretty straightforward. Picks up everything, including those elusive dust bunnies. Goes under beds & couches. Easy to clean out the bin. Only con is it's pretty loud."
11/20/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Just like all the other reviews... excellent.,This thing is great.Ê Get one and enjoy.
05/12/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,worth every penny,this thing is awesome...I was skeptical at first but sold on it. I have two large dogs that shed a lot and for the most part this keeps up with it. holds a good charge and gets all sections of the room.Ê easy to operate/clean etc.. so far so good.
7/17/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Best Roomba ever,"This thing is awesome. Hair does not get stuck in it like in older models. It also doesn't do quite as good of a job, but it's close enough. The best part is the hepa filter that cuts down the dust in my house and makes everything feel clean. Love it."
11/02/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Convenient and effective little sucker,"This thing is amazing. We let it run nightly, and we've seen such an improvement in the amount of fur floating around. We have pets that shed heavily, and this has really reduced the frequency with which I need to thoroughly vacuum the whole house. We don't have any carpeting, with the exception of a couple small rugs by the doors, and the Roomba has never had any issues with those.This is our first Roomba, so I cannot compare new features to the previous models. We've yet to have any issues with tangling of hair/fur. The battery life has been great, and it's very easy to program. With frequent use, the bin size is sufficiently large.Ê If we skip a day, it will fill up and we'll need to empty/restart it, but that's just the nature of living with our heavy-shedders.A minor negative (and it is super minor) is that we've had to loosen/tighten the side-spinning brush at times to prevent some odd noises and to get it actually spinning again. Otherwise, it functions just as well (really a bit better) than I expected. Another downside is that it can be a little loud. If you're a light sleeper, it can definitely wake you up if it runs at night. We've programmed it to run around the time we need to be up anyway, so it's not a big issue for us.Fun fact: if you leave shoes anywhere the Roomba will vacuum, it may relocate them for you. I've awoken to find a flipflop from the entryway halfway across the foyer on more than a few occasions."
2/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Technology Making Life Far Better,This thing is amazing. We have three cats and a toddler but I had no idea how much filth we lived in until we bought this. We run it every day and I'm grateful every time I hear that little chime come on indicating it's running. The rubber rollers are an wonderful replacement for brushes and the whole thing takes very little upkeep.
8/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,What are your expectations?,This thing is amazing!Ê I left some negative feedback for the seller because I had a problem getting what I ordered but this is about the product. It does just what we wanted it to do.Ê We have two long haired dogs.Ê A springer spaniel mix and a Golden.Ê We have rolling tumbleweeds of hair in our apartment.Ê A real pain pulling out the real vacuum when it gets too noticeable.Ê Amazingly my skittish Golden doesn't seem to mind it.Ê Even lets it bump into him and bounce off.Ê This is a dog that freaks if you step over him or drop the leash loudly on the floor.Ê it's very quiet and we can let it roam the apartment while we do other things.Ê We're still learning what it will do and continually surprised.Ê I had to help it one time get around a mess of speaker wires and electrical chords but it did NOT get wrapped up in them.Ê I just had to lift it off.Ê After that I secured the wires to the wall and that was the end of that issue.Ê I love the way it goes under chairs and tables where I can't ever get with the upright vacuum.Ê That always seems to be where the little tumbleweeds of dog hair seem to congregate until the HVAC decides to blast it around.Ê This thing would never substitute for an occasional cleaning with a really powerful vacuum like a Shark or Dyson but it certainly takes care of the in between days and reduces the number of times I really feel we NEED the other vacuum.Ê I'm a happy camper.
01/03/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,This thing is AMAZING! I have it set to vacuum my place ...,"This thing is AMAZING!Ê I have it set to vacuum my place at noon during the work week when I am not home.Ê It allows you to schedule which days of the week you want it to work.Ê I have my home professionally cleaned once a month, and this is a perfect companion to a deep cleaning.Ê I am overly impressed by it.Ê So impressed that I purchased a second one for my office two weeks after buying the first one.Ê I would rate this a 10 out of 10.Ê I am amazed at how little dust there is in my place now after using this daily."
7/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,This Roomba is pretty awesome. Cleans up well and you don't have ...,This Roomba is pretty awesome.Ê Cleans up well and you don't have to worry about anything.Ê Easy to set up and empty.Ê Works great on all surfaces. I recommend to anyone with long hair or pets.
7/29/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Amazing,"This Roomba is incredible.Ê I have been using it in my beach house...sand, debris, etc. and I am amazed at how fantastic it is.Ê It always surprises me when I open it to clean it, how much dirt and debris it has picked up.Ê Everytime it finds it's way back to the base, I am in awe.Ê With three dogs and kids it is a godsend.Ê Expensive but so worth it."
9/26/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Well worth it!,"This Roomba is amazing!Ê We have two cats, and the amount of hair it picks up on a daily basis is amazing.Ê We have tile, hardwood, and a large area rug, and the Roomba has no trouble going from room to room.Ê I love that you can schedule it to vacuum at 3am while you sleep!Ê Two big thumbs up."
07/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Best. Vacuum. Ever.,"This Roomba cleans like no other!Ê I have owned four Roomba cleaners over the past 10 years and have bought them as gifts.Ê The 880 has everything I ever wanted in a robotic vacuum already included.Ê It has scheduling built in and easily programmable.Ê The lighthouse barriers are sensor-activated, meaning you just place them and they only turn on when the robot is nearby.Ê No need to place / move / replace them or worry about whether you activated the virtual walls.Ê Bonus feature: it has a feature that keeps the cleaner within 1 room with the virtual wall until she (mine is named Rosie the Robot) decides the room is clean.Ê Then she goes to the next room!My wife and I are amazed at how much dust and dirt the cleaner manages to pick up vacuuming every few days.Ê It is entirely self-maintaining, only needing us to stop by once or twice a week to empty the dust bin and clean the filter.Ê Rosie always finds her way back to home base for charging, and has never once gotten stuck or pulled out a hair of our rug fringed edge.Ê If I won the lottery, I'd definitely buy a second one!"
9/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"This robot which I named ""vroomvroom"" is absolutely wonderful and delivers","This robot which I named ""vroomvroom"" is absolutely wonderful and delivers. So far no problem and it doesn't attack the extension cords. Returning to its base as expected. Love it"
4/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great for picking up SAND!,"This robot was purchased to help with the incredible amount of sand that is tracked into my beach house (camp).Ê I was a little reluctant to try it at first, but decided to give it a shot and return it if we did not like it.Ê To my surprise, it works like a charm.Ê The vacuum picks up sand remarkably well, and finds itself into every room of my 2000+square foot camp.Ê I absolutely love the fact that it has sensors so we do not have to program it where to go.Ê It even knows where there is stairs, and does not fall down.Ê The Roomba gets lost occasionally and its battery dies before it makes it back to the charger, but for the amount of sand it picks up, I can live with having to search for it every now and then.Ê It also gets stuck on one of my bathroom rugs, which is big and fluffy, so no wonder why it gets stuck.Ê I can easily solve that problem by closing the door, or setting up the blockers that come with the robot.Ê The vacuum is loud, so there is no TV watching while it's in the room.Ê My kids hate it, because it vacuums up their small toys...they will just have to learn to pick up their toys so they do not get sucked up ;)Ê The vacuum does not take the place of sweeping or mopping, I just use it as extra means for keeping sand off our floors."
07/02/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,You can't rely on iRobot to honor their warranty!,"This rating is completely do to iRobots horrible customer service. Simply put, they do not honor their warranty, even within the first 30 days. When you are dropping $700 on a vacuum cleaner, you need to be able to trust that the company who built it will keep its word, and do the right thing if the vacuum is defective. iRobot will not.I was sent a defective Roomba 880 (one of the motors didn't work properly). I notified iRobot within the first 30 days, and asked them to replace it, and extend the warranty. They advertise a 30 day money back guarantee, so I thought I'd give them a chance at a do-over.Ê Not only did iRobot refuse to fully extend the warranty on the replacement unit, but they also refused to fully swap out the defective unit (they offered to swap out only parts of it). Then, as added salt in the wound, this penny-pinching company tried to tell me that I had to PAY to ship the defective one back to them!This unit had only two weeks of use, and the CLAIM that they have a 30 day moneyback guarantee. I was disgusted with their refusal to take full responsibility, and so informed them I wanted to return the unit for a refund under that guarantee. However, when I asked for a refund, they then ignored the request!Luckily, I bought this through Amazon, and Amazon also has a 30 day return policy. In the face of iRobots horrible service, Amazon has been good enough to do what iRobot would not, and refund my money.Ê If it had been more that thirty days, however, I would have been screwed by this company that does not honor its promises, or stand behind its product.****UPDATE***I have upped my review from one star, to three stars.Ê Here is why: after writing the review above I received one of those email ""How was your customer service experience?""Ê questionnaires from iRobot.Ê I filled it out as one might expect from my review above, except that I also included the names of the service representative and the manager I had dealt with.In response I was contacted the next day directly by iRobots Director of Global Customer Care. My experience with her was everything that my previous experiences with iRobot's service department was not. She was gracious, intelligent, and I believe that she was honestly appalled by my experience with her company.Ê She had had also diligently reviewed my all of my previous correspondences with the service department, before reaching out to me (a step I very much appreciated, and one that I believe spoke volumes about the critical approach she took to the matter at hand).Ê I am hopeful that the current penny-pinching paradigm in iRobots service department is now being addressed, and will be less of a problem for future customers."
12/01/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,product is excellent,"This product is just amazing. After we received, we test it out and its just awesome, we all love this product. 100% recommended,"
07/07/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,Breakdown expected in the first 3 months with a tricky warranty coverage designed to avoid responsibility,"This product is announced as being equipped with the latest technology and an ""INTERNATIONAL Warranty"". Let me tell you my experience:1. The software became corrupted in the 3rd month after purchase. The program module has to be replaced for some reason. I live right next to the sea and it's not that dusty (nor humid as indoor AC controlled 24/7), the vacuum is programmed to clean a 2 bedroom flat (100 sam in size) 4 times a week. At its 42nd or 44th clean, the software went crazy and keep the side brush spinning when switched off / recharging, but no spin during clean. This means that the brush spins and produces huge noise when recharging / idling / doing nothing. The only way to stop it, is to screw open the battery cover and remove the battery -- Obviously this is not the best battery life extending method.This is NOT the issue in the Manual Troubleshooting as the brush axis being entrangled by hair, but simply a software failure that messes up the spinning program. ------------ If it is a product with the LATEST Tech, well, it is a mature and sophisticatedly developed and tested new tech;2. INTERNATIONAL Warranty. Be extremely careful with these warranty. It is supposed to have you covered world-wide in their ads campaign. Hang no a sec guys: it is NOT. i've bought this thing in states and travelled to another country with it hoping the Amercian product can help me keep the house clean. Within the 2nd month of regular use, this piece of machine has become an useless expensive decoration and i called the local distributor: NOT covered, not only you have to pay for the delivery, you have to replace the software module as well. Irobot company covers nothing at all for this manufacture defect. How about the US. customer care as this product was purchased in the states? I've sent my compliant for over 50 hours without any reply.I'm appalled to find out this gigantic (at least portraited in their ads)Ê multibillion international firm with manufacturing facility in China, isn't confident enough to warranty their product internationally. And, indeed, you know what? this hardware crash down within the first 50 times of use justifies perfectly their warranty policy: defect has been expected and free repair or exchange has been avoided by their terms in warranty.3. The product itself. this thing loves challenging the least expected and necessary corners to be cleaned. For example, if it's set to clean a huge living room with a sofa set and tea table, its most concentrated area is the narrow gap between your sofa set and the wall, leaving the huge area untended, it attempts time after time to enter into that small gap, again and again. when being physically placed in the center of the living room and restarted, it seeks and rushes to that gap dead straight without any deviation. it's like being programmed to try to clean those impossible corners as priority, while ignoring the vast easy area needs to be cleaned.Overall, the software issue disappoints me and their warranty insulted me!!!"
9/26/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Great for apartments w/ dogs,"This product is a game changer if you live in an apartment with a dog.Ê I used to have to vacuum all the time and I hated it.I set my Roomba up for daily cleanings and when I come home from work, I just empty the bin and that's all I have to do.It's great on hardwood floors, but can have some trouble with thicker hair on thick carpets.Ê The change smell in my apartment is dramatic because of this product.It'll occasionally get stuck in weird places but the homing beacons do a good job of keeping it from going in areas that you don't want it to go in.Overall, I'd highly recommend this product."
6/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Love Rudy the Roomba,"This product changed my life. I was vacuuming every 1-2 days and my hard wood floors were still dirty in between with kids food, dog hair, grass, dirt ect. We do not even wear shoes in the house.Ê Now I run ""Rudy"" the Roomba almost nightly and only vacuum myself once a week. There are some areas that I will always do better in my house such as over certain rugs with lots of dog hair or places the Roomba can not fit but overall it has been great. I empty the trash bin usually 1-3 times after a nightly run and its full of all those yucky things. It amazing how much dirt there is on those floors after just a day. We have a shedding dog and 3 kids. It isÊ also amazing on our carpeted areas and I run it on those rooms about once a week. I had people over this weekend, cleaned up the dishes and just ran Rudy to clean the floors; It was great! Strongly recommend. My husband was very hesitant about this product because of the cost, but now even he loves Rudy."

7/23/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,More than Five Stars,"This one far outshines my old 595i iRobot. Along with it being new & improved, it's also a #%*+ lot easier to clean."
9/21/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Four Stars,"This machine is very good in many ways, but the battery is not durable"
07/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Magical Machine,"This machine is magical and worth every penny.Ê Not only is it fun to watch (at first), but it actually keeps my 2,000 square feet of hardwood dog-hair free.Ê I used to vacuum twice daily because i hate how dog hair stands out on hardwood floors.Ê No more...this lil' guy gave me back 2 hours a day!Ê Love it!"
6/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,and will easily clean under furniture with 12cm tall feet or higher,"This little robot turns cleaning the house a job MUCH easiear. There are already a lot of reviews of it here, so I'm just going to add the two points that I've not found elsewhere until I had this robot:Roomba is about 9cm tall, and will easily clean under furniture with 12cm tall feet or higher.Roomba is not perfect because it does scratch a little the floor (that's why it didn't receive a 5 star rating from me). My floor is burnt cement, more resistent floors may not have this problem."
01/03/2016,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great for busy households.,"This little machine sure makes a huge difference in our house.Ê Dust and allergens have been reduced and she picks up more than our regular vacuum.Ê You'll notice I refer to the Roomba as she, we named her Rosie.Ê Rosie has won us all over.Ê She encourages my son to pick up his toys as he doesnt want Rosie eating them, and helps encourage us adults to pick up after ourselves too.Ê We love watching her do her thing!Ê I would highly recommend this great device to any busy household and even to those that just dont like to vacuum."
10/23/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,A Veritable Robot,"This little gizmo reminds me of the Twilight Zone episode ""I Sing the Body Electric,"" where the husband seeks a robot nanny to care for his children. Everyone is, of course, dubious until the miraculous electrical ""Grandma"" shows up and whips the house and children into shape. Well, substitute ""roomba"" for ""nanny"" and ""vacuum"" for ""care for children"" and you pretty much get the picture. This little robot is a fantastic servant for cleaning pet hair and grime; its pleasantly quiet; finds dirt you never will; and charmingly finds it's way home to charge. I ordered one, and after a day, ordered another for the upstairs. Can't speak to the earlier models, but this 880 is simply fantastic."
7/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,This latest version 880 is awesome in almost all respects,"This latest version 880 is awesome in almost all respects.Ê Functionally it is 5 star.Ê The missing star, surprisingly, is poor documentation by iRobot.Ê Not only does the documentation leave you as a user short on how to properly use it, namely the ""lighthouses"", I couldn't find the clues on iRobot's site.Ê Had to drill down into user blogs.Ê If your house is anything like ours, you need this info to understand what is going on with the Roomba and lighthouse communication to guide this really cool tool through your home.Actually, my discovery astounded me.Ê The Roomba and lighthouses communicate with radio and infrared beams--not to mention the Roomba's internal optical sensors observing around and underneath for dirt searching and control.Ê Without knowing this, and how the lighthouses talk to each other, the Roomba, and the base dock, you will be shortchanged.Ê Our space is a large u-shaped living area leading into an entry hall and a bath off of that.Ê The base, where the Roomba starts (and ends) is in the living room part.Ê The first lighthouse guards the entry to the kitchen/dining area and it won't let the Roomba pass until it has spent enough time in the living room.Ê That lighthouse must be in line of sight to the base dock because they communicate via radio.Ê Eventually, that lighthouse lets the Roomba into the kitchen dining area.Ê The next lighthouse blocks the entry hall and bath until the Roomba has spent enough time in the kitchen/dining area.Ê That second lighthouse must be in line of sight with the first light house, again because they're all talking by radio.Ê Eventually, the second lighthouse lets the Roomba into the hall and bath area and won't let it out until it has spent enough time there.Ê Finally, the second lighthouse approves the release of the Roomba which sets itself in dock mode and works it's way back to the dock in the living room guided by both lighthouses radio communication and precisely docks like the space shuttle, sounding a victory chime and goes into charge mode.Ê All automatic!Ê Amazing!Ê A true robot.Problem is, iRobot doesn't, anywhere I can find in their literature explain to you how the lighthouse communication works which blocks your ability to effectively use these amazing tools to send your Roomba on a mission through your home.Ê Otherwise, I can't say enough about the Roomba 880's awesome capabilities.It is important to follow the thing around the first time or two to keep emptying the small trash container, as recommended, especially if you have pet hair.Ê In fact, before the first cleaning, if pet hair is an issue, I'd get out the big gun vacuum to clean up as much of the hair as possible, then go from there.Ê It is also important to run the Roomba daily to stay ahead of trash so you don't have to keep dumping it.Great tool!"

It's a vacuum that randomly roams around. It has no AI or any real 'intelligence' whatsoever. It's a vacuum with wheels that moves by itself, not a robot. I returned it after 3-4 days because it was pretty worthless."
1/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Five Stars,This is your best friend at home!!! I love it!!!
10/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Cannot recommend enough - BEST PRODUCT FOR YOUR HOME.,"This is the single best thing we have ever bought for our home. The Roomba is easily programmed and we set it for two hours before we get home from work. We have mainly hardwood floors with transition strips between all the rooms (Why? ask the previous owner!). Throw rugs cover large areas and there are always a couple of cords crisscrossing the rooms if my husband is in the middle of a project. The Roomba navigates everything with ease.Best feature of this is the ability to easily take it apart to clean the rollers and wheel and three armed brush mechanisms. I have very long hair - the Roomba seems to pick up every strand that has fallen out. The ends of the rollers, behind the wheel and under the brush will get filled with a wad of hair and need to be cleaned at least monthly. Takes 5 minutes and the hair comes off as a curled up ball - no untangling or anything really annoying.The Roomba will clean about half of our home on one charge. It probably will clean more, but it is not the charge that prevents this - it is emptying the bin. We seem to be swimming in a sea of dust - at least this is what it looks like when we empty the Roomba! It is this limitation which would prevent me from recommending the upgrade to the newest version - unless the hopper is bigger, you still are limited on how much area the Roomba will cover by having to empty it.That said - we don't use the towers. Instead we try to get the ""maid"" as we call her, to clean one are at a time by trapping her. The timing program still works if we remove the Roomba from the charging station in the morning and place it in a closed room so that the focus is the bedroom on Monday, for example.Highly recommend. Quiet when running - won't damage your furniture. It doesn't ""go down stairs"" and won't crash to it's death. IRobot has created a very user friendly product which works, consistently and effectively. Reduced my allergy issues as well - the dust pick up is amazing."

9/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,My Best Decision,"This is the best purchase I have made in a long time.Ê I have always liked the idea of having a Roomba, but just didn't want to spend the money.Ê I bought one for my daughter for Christmas.Ê She was so pleased with the performance that I bought the 880 for myself.Ê I have a shepherd mix that sheds a lot.Ê There was always dog hair along the baseboards and under the furniture and my allergies were terrible.Ê I schedule my Roomba to vacuum every day.Ê The amount of hair and gross stuff it picks up is amazing.Ê I clean the hepa filter every time. I no longer have trails of dog hair around the edges of the room or under the furniture and my allergies are much better.Ê It is wonderful to come home and have my floors neat and clean without any effort on my part."
12/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,This is the best investment I ever made in my home cleaning routine,"This is the best investment I ever made in my home cleaning routine.Ê I am amazed at how well it picks up dirt, how gentle it moves around furniture and how well it adapts to a new environment.Ê After having in for a few months, I really don't know how I functioned without it.Ê With two indoor dogs, it is almost a necessity."
06/02/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Amazing machine,This is the best cleaning machine I have ever bought. I bought Roomba 880 for my mom and she loved it. It make the house very clean and easy to clean it. I strongly recommend it.
2/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,This is the absolute best thing I have ever purchased,"This is the absolute best thing I have ever purchased!!!Ê We have two English Mastiffs that are indoors. Together they weigh about 350 lbs so you can imagine the hair and dust. The Roomba 880 takes care of it all, no problem. 2,500 sq ft of mostly hard floors but also does clean rugs and carpets well too!Ê I'm just sorry I waited so long to get one!"
2/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,WONDERFUL AND FASCINATING,"This is so wonderful and so automatic that my kids were so impressed, they just ordered one also.Ê A note, you want the 880.Ê It comes with a guidance system so the 800 can find its way in multiple room situations, back to its docking station, automatically.Ê All model 800's are the same machine.Ê The last two digits indicate the accessories.When you register your 880 they will send you 2 extra hepa filters.Ê I have already ordered more from Amazon.Ê They get dirty real fast and even though you wipe them off it still feels like you will want to replace them every month or so.And the reviews where people say that it is fascinating to watch - they are not crazy, it's true.Ê Especially if you have small kids who like to run over and press the button or cats thatÊ move out of its way."
10/13/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Works Well and is Fun!,"This is so cool! Keeps the floors generally in good shape. You'll want to wet mop once in awhile still, but this does take the regular vacuuming work away. Visitors are like WoW! Now if they'll make one that cooks and tends bar...."
7/30/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,The best vacuum for cat hair ever,This is our third Roomba.Ê We have three indoor hairy cats and Roomba does an excellent job of picking up the hair.Ê It has extended the life of our carpet for it does a great job vacuuming.Ê The carpets look very clean when it's finished.Ê We have one upstairs and one downstairs and sent a third to college student at school. This is the best vacuum.Ê My favorite activity is to play video games while you vacuum!
05/01/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Third Time Around,"This is our third Roomba and probably the best. However, be aware that I love all of our Roombas. This Roomba is a champ. It did a wonderful job in our family room which is carpeted with a low profile Berber. It can take virtually any surface and goes under furniture such as couches, chairs, end tables, etc. The only thing it didn't go under is the big screen tv stand which only has an inch separation from its bottom shelf to the floor. The Roomba uses a triangulation pattern that covers the entire floor surface as it traverses all floor areas multiple times. It is confined by a laser like tower which defines the area to be cleaned and confines the Roomba to a specific physical area. When it has cleaned everything, it returns to its dock to recharge its battery. If stairs are involved, the RoombaÊ senses the change and will not fall. In the interim, you should empty the bin that collects the debris before the next programmedÊ cleaning.Since my sister has three cats and enough cat hair to knit a sweater, I tested Roomba at her house. Not surprisingly the area tested was spotless after Roomba finished. I ran over the cleaned area with her Dyson. It picked up nothing.Roomba spins around and does a great job around floorboards as well as normal fuzz bunny areas. Periodically small brushes and filters may need to be replaced, but good maintenance keeps replacement of parts infrequent.There are a lot of models available dependent on your needs. This is great for pet owners because it picks up a lot of hair as well as the usual dust and dirt. As I write this, it is cleaning the master bedroom and walk in closet. What a champ."
9/28/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,880 appears to have a better design. The rollers are rubber and not brushes,"This is our second Roomba.Ê The first, a 560, lasted about 4 years before it succumbed to pet hair in the workings.Ê I had to totally take the gear box apart on the 560 a couple of times to clean it out, but eventually, it gave up.Ê This new, 880 appears to have a better design.Ê The rollers are rubber and not brushes.Ê Pet hair does not get into the internals as easily.Ê The 880 is a bit larger than the 560 - it is a little taller and a little bigger across.Ê So it does not fit into some small spaces.Ê Overall, I like it much better.Ê It is quieter and does not get into trouble (hung up) very often.Ê It picks up so much dirt and pet hair, I need to empty it every day.Ê That's a good thing, I guess."
07/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,"Horrible service, they just don't care","This is our second Roomba in 5 years and its gone down the drain again way too soon for all the money we paid. Contacted their service department to just get a couple of links posted back to me to track down the issue myself. The Roomba says its charged but dies soon after. What else is there to troubleshoot. Horrible service, they just don't care. Not buying another one."
10/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"works great, WE LOVE THESE THINGS and have nothing but ...","this is our second RoombaÊ and it has more features than the first, works great, WE LOVE THESE THINGS and have nothing but good to say abouttheir performance. saves us another chore every day."
3/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Cleans well but area rug transition could be better,"This is our second robot, got a Roomba 880 last year that works better with transitions but for the price (and the mopping) the bobsweep still deserves 5 stars"
10/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Good for hard floors,"This is our first robot. We have mixed feelings. It does a pretty good job on hard surfaces, but rugs are a problem. We have wool rugs, and it balls up the wool and leaves it everywhere making a worse mess than we started with. Also, it has to be emptied a LOT. We ran it in an empty carpeted room and had to empty it 4 times before it finished. We've had it about 2-3 months. At first it would dock itself before the battery died but now we find it stranded somewhere with a dead battery. Another problem we have with rugs seems to be with dark colors. We have a rug with black background that it absolutely will not work on. If we place it on the rug it turns off every time. We think because of the color it thinks it's at the edge of stairs? Anyway, for hard floors it's a nice timesaver; but for rugs and carpet it's more work than help."
09/03/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Efficient Product - Happy User !,"This is our feedback after a couple of weeks of use of the new Roomba.Roomba is a good vacuum cleaner especially for vacuuming smaller areas. Because of the battery life, cleaning a larger space is an issue.It does its job pretty efficiently. The noise level has reduced compared to the earlier models which is nice. Features like scheduling is great to have.I would have loved to have a larger bin on this vacuum cleaner. The bin needs to be constantly emptied (we have a Labrador in our house and he sheds) as it gets filled up quickly.The spot cleaning is a little cryptic; am still trying to figure out how to efficiently do this using the remote control.One thing that I have observed is that the Roomba sometimes (few) gets stuck at places like below our dishwasher and kitchen cabinets. Not sure why this happens because at other times it cleans those areas without any issues.Also I would suggest fellow users to minimize the obstructions in the area being cleaned. That way the Roomba does a faster job. For example we remove the chairs in our dining area before setting Roomba there.Overall, happy with the product !"
9/28/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,880 vs. 650,"This is not necessarily a negative review, but a review that should make you consider the Roomba 650 instead.Ê I had two Roomba 880s before I switched to the 650; the 880s were never able to find their home docking station.Ê I'm not sure if they were defective, I had a poor layout in my house, or they just weren't that intuitive, but I did switch to the 650.Ê THAT is not really why I would like others to consider the 650.Ê Here is why:1. HEPA is actually only attainable in a closed seal on your dust bin, something that a battery operated machine will never have the power to do.Ê It is just a marketing ploy--feel free to look this up and not take my word for it.2. The virtual wall/lighthouse feature was worthless on both of my 880s.Ê I let the Roomba Jr. (as I call it, the 650 model that is) run its course a couple of times a week and it is able to clean all visible carpet that I can tell, and return to its docking station.Ê No need for the virtual wall/lighthouses in my opinion.3. No remote with the 650, but why do you need one?4. The only truly remarkable (albeit probably not worth $300 more) advantage of the 880 is the brushes have no bristles, so you do not have to clean them.5. It's really not that much quieter than the 650, although people claim this in reviews.6. Battery life between 880 and 650 were the same.7. I have terrible allergies and they did not change between models.Our 650, Roomba Jr., has been smarter and more effective than the big brother.Ê In fact, we empty just as much from the bin weekly in Jr. as we did the 880.Ê I really can't see the purpose of purchasing an 880.Ê I hope my review doesn't go overlooked since there are so many reviews out there."
2/26/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Not a very good vacuum cleaner,"This is not a very good vacuum cleaner. I did a comparison between the Roomba and my old Dyson that I plan to replace. Both vacuums collected dirt in a loft and a hallway. The Roomba had two passes at the area FIRST, running a complete power cycle each time, but collected only about 2/3 of the total dirt obtained. I just think a vacuum cleaner at this price point should do a better job vacuuming.It also gets stuck a lot and that requires attention to resolve.If you have pets and just want to get the top layer of pet hair and dirt off of your floors this might be something you want. It will do that. But I really wanted a vacuum cleaner and, for me at this price point, the product just won't do. I returned it."
1/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,Poor battery!!,"This is my second vacuum cleaning robot. The first, which lasted for around four years, was a brand called InDream, and was quite sufficient, but died. I then decided to go for a top model.It worked great the first couple of months (start October to mid/end November) - more quiet than the old, quite efficient and better brushes. But it had to be in the docking station all the time (when it was not running) - a day out of it and the battery was very low (contrary to my old one which could be out of the dock for a week or so).It then began to not charging and reporting frequent Error 5, so, in accordance to the manual, I made sure no battery contacts was dirty, but still the same. Then in December it completely gave up and wouldn't charge.It went to the repair shop and got the battery exchanged. After one cleaning it started with Error 5 again, and now, two days after, it made some dying noises and won't charge again.If the battery worked, I would perhaps recommend it, but not as it has behaved for me."
07/07/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I need more robots,"This is my second Roomba. I was extremely happy with my first one, the workhorse 560 model, but after two years and multiple replacement parts, the robot developed a mind of its own and the weakened battery made him lazy. When he went two weeks straight without making it back to his base, we knew it was time for a new battery, but we opted instead for an upgrade and went with the top of the line 880.I was sort of hoping that the newer model used most of the same parts as the older one, since I still had replacements left over, but unfortunately, the only common part is the side swiping rotary brush. Fortunately, however, everything else, from the high volume bin with HEPA filter, to the brushless pick up rollers, is actually new and improved. The brushless rollers in particular are a godsend, because they eliminate the tedious task of removing pet hair (we have two long haired Persian cats) after each run. This also eliminated the need for special tools to clean the brush, which were one more disadvantage of the older model. The high volume bin has a flip open lid that makes dirt removal easy and doesnt require as much finagling as the older style bin.One legacy part that works with the 880 is the old virtual wall. I use this to limit the area the Roomba has to clean on any given day, since our house is a large ranch that the Roomba can easily get lost in. The old virtual wall works really well in tandem with the lighthouses that came with the new one, which allow you to force the Roomba to clean one room before going on to the next. They also can be used as virtual walls, if you need to further limit the Roombas range. I also like the remote control, which allows me to play with the robot, if I am so inclined. It lets you specify a direction or cleaning mode, or I can just bother the cats and my wife if I want. Of course with the onboard scheduling, you can set it and forget it (except for bin and filter cleaning) and the robot cleans up all on its own. Cleaning ability is much improved on this new model, thanks mainly to the efficient pick up rollers, and even though suction is improved, the 880 is much quieter than the old 560. It also has better sensing abilities overall, which means it does a lot fewer full speed butts into walls and objects. The mostly black housing is sleeker and less obtrusive, too, making the Roomba feel like more a part of the home and less like an appliance that somebody dumped in the corner of the room.Although the Roomba is still not good enough to clean a large house completely and effectively on its own, for keeping dirt and cat hair to a minimum and maintaining a respectable level of clean around the house without a lot of fuss and effort, it is second to none. I hope that iRobot keeps developing new robots and improving their old ones just like they did from the 560 to the 880. If they do, I will continue to fill my house with these five star wonders."
01/06/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Pays for itself in first year!!!,"This is my second Roomba. I bought a model 6 years ago and have only replaced the battery.Ê Extremely reliable and decided to buy the 880 for my downstairs.Ê The new model (880) has stronger vacuum. How do I know, the following items have been emptied at the end of the day: 1 paperclip, 1 US quarter, 1 US dime, 1 screw, 1 paper US dollar, 1 one inch long 1/4 inch diameter steel pin, and enough hair to claim I own a cat. LOL, it pays for itself within the first year of ownership, just empty it before another family member gets to it..."
12/18/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Five Stars,This is my second roomba.Ê Would not want to go back to manually sweeping.
5/14/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,No more vacuuming,"This is my second Roomba.Ê Having a house with hardwood floors and three dogs, vacuuming is a daily necessity.Ê We just let Roomba (a/k/a Hazel) vacuum while we're at work and come home to clean floors.Ê The Roomba 880 seems to have resolved some minor glitches from previous models.Ê Definately a keeper."
5/23/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Love My Roomba 880,"This is my second Roomba, I purchased the very first generation and the battery life never did very well, threw it away. I was a bit leery to purchase another until my son told about how great his worked. He purchased one at Costco for $300 that does not have all the features that the 880 has.I opted for the 880 model due to the rollers and the way it picks up dog hair. I have two cocker spaniels along with tile and wood flooring throughout my home. We also have a silk rug and a Persian wool rug. The iRobot is a dream come true! I do not have to lug out the central vac every two days to pick up fur balls floating around the house.I haven't programmed it yet, but I will. I just need to sit and read the manual. I would recommend the unit for purchase, it's worth it."
11/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Its like having a Maid,This is my first roomba. I just love it . makes me wonder why any one would ever vacume manually. Sure if you want to put in a lot of work you can do better vacuming than the roomba. But for normal day to day clenleness the roomba can handle pretty much anything. You just drop it down in a room start up the clean cycle and like magic come back to the room later and its been vacumed. I have it set to vacume everyday my room in the morning and it does it everyday and goes back the charger no problem when its done. Emptying it out is also no problem. Having a roomba does make you more aware on what you put on the floor because it can get stuck every now and then. But this roomba is a tank some times it will go over thing no problem. Overall was worried it was going to be a horrible purchase when I got it but so far no regrets
10/19/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,"Effective, if flawed (and expensive) vacuum.","This is my first Roomba and I am generally pleased. It's a fun gadget to have and it works pretty much as described.PROS:- works great on hard floors and low-pile carpet.- quiet enough where it's not terribly distracting.- impressive battery life.- easy to clean/maintain.CONS:- not great on thicker carpets or wool rugs that shed a lot. (The rubber ""extractors"" can get clogged with the wool fibers).- it's not as intelligent as I was expecting. It's very random in its pattern of sweeping -- so you have to give it a lot of time to cover everything.Ê Also, as far as I can tell, it doesn't seem to ""learn"" rooms. So each time it starts, it is as random as before.- minor design flaw:Ê there is a ""dirt sensor"" in the vacuum that is designed to ""listen"" for dirt;Ê when it detects a lot of dirt, it instructs the Roomba to focus on an area until it senses no more dirt.Ê In my experience this sensor is malfunctioning frequently -- causing the Roomba to spin in circles and focus on a 2' x 2' section of floor endlessly.Ê The fix is to remove the dirt bin and rubber extractor rollers and clean off the sensor (which is hidden behind the rollers).Ê This works, but I'm having to do it nearly every day and it's a bit of an inconvenience.Bottom line: fun, albeit expensive vacuum. Glad I purchased it, but not blown away by it.Ê If Amazon allowed half-stars, I'd have given it 3.5 stars."
4/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Happy for the purchase!,"This is my first review. It is just amazing that this robot works so well, that I have to tell everyone.Ê I decided to get iRobot 880 because of my busy schedule, and I dont want to sacrifice to have a dirty house for my kids.Ê This iRobot 880 does an AMAZING job and sucks out all the dusts, and goes to hard to reach area.Ê We have hard wood floor with area rugs in each room.Ê There was a review saying it does not go on dark surface so I was nervous about it.Ê Surprisingly, or luckily, mine went on to my sons navy blue border carpet (pottery barn kids carpet if you want to know how dark it is).Ê Maybe it is not dark enough to the robotluckily!Ê You can feel the floor is clean by walking with bare feet.Ê Kids love her too and they know mommy can spend more time with them because of the robots hard work.Ê Love it!"
4/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Best purchase ever?!,"This is my first review ever and in full disclosure I did not purchase my Roomba from Amazon.Ê I felt compelled to write a review because this is probably one of my favorite purchases ever.Ê It works incredibly well and I can not believe how much dirt, dust, and hair it picks up.Ê If you are on the fence about getting one, do it!"
3/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Love it!,This is my first iRobot. I would say I am impressed by its design and its intelligence. So glad that I am relieved from sweeping or vacuuming!
02/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Love this little machine!!,This is my favorite piece of equipment I have ever owned. I have 2 dogs and I cannot believe what this little machine picks up. You can set the schedule and off it goes. Electronic sensors detect stairs...I move it up and down stairs on alternate days. I have wide open rooms which make it easy to maneuver. I don't know how I lived without the Roomba!!
9/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,This is my 4th roomba and by far the best in terms of suction,"This is my 4th roomba and by far the best in terms of suction, and ease of cleaning up. I have dogs so the old Roomba brushes were always time consuming to clean. This one uses rubber rollers that do a better job of cleaning surfaces and are a breeze to clean periodically.This is my favorite roomba to date. The price was a bit steep. I would expect this to come down in time. I still wish we had more control over the roomba via a smartphone or computer. I tend to loose remotes.On a side note, I've read some comments about the roomba not being so great with pet ""accidents"" in the home. As a dog fanatic I can honestly say this is clearly a problem with improper training and should not be blamed on the roomba. Learn how to properly housebreak a pet. Remember, anger is not discipline."
01/03/2016,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,770 versus 880 versus 980 - I have them All,This is hands down better than the Neato units (owned all of them).Ê You can also tell from comparing the total review star rating for each.I like this unit as much as my Roomba 770.Ê You can see my review for that (it's the first one that pops up).The latest Roomba 980 with it's navigation..

2/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,"Countless flaws, but I totally LOVE it!","This is an early review. I've had my Roomba 880 for less than week, but have used it every day. Let me tell you all the problems I have with it. Caveat: I may not have figured it out, which is also a flaw in the documentation and design, because it's a household appliance albeit a sophisticated piece of electronics.Ê My criticisms are almost all about its technological deficits. It's 2015 and my expectations are high.CONS:1. The battery indicator only shows FULL (green) or CHARGING (yellow) or DEPLETED (red). There should be an indication of percentage. I can find nothing in the documentation telling me how long it takes to charge or how long I might expect it to run. I'm aware battery health and life changes, but if my phone and laptop can estimate based on normal usage, so can iRobot. I know they know.2.Ê It can't return to the dock if it doesn't have line-of-sight, which means it can't locate the dock from another room or even around a corner. Roomba has died in different parts of my house twice when I let it have access to other rooms and I had to go looking for it with a flashlight - it was under a piece of furniture.3. Roomba has a near useless remote control, also is infrared powered, so it has to be a few feet away to connect. All it really can do with assuredness is turn the device on and off. The directional controls are terrible. Buttons aren't labeled.4.Most important: The 880, top of the line, newest version, doesn't have bluetooth connectivity or what would be even better, Wi-fi. This would allow for control with a smartphone app. Come on iRobot! You guys have been doing this for a decade, and yet now when everyone is coming up with internet-connected homes, you're sitting there with your dopey IR remote! It's lame and insulting to buyers.5. User programming is pathetic too. Basically you can only program it to leave the dock and start sweeping once a day.Ê That's it. You can set the start time, but not a stop time! It just runs until it dies somewhere off in another part of the house with no ability to get home. If you want it to work while you're away you must carry the Roomba and the dock to the room you want cleaned, set up barriers (virtual walls or close doors). Later you can do it again somewhere else. Insult upon injury, when setting the timer, there's no direct entry.It's like a 20 year old digital clock. You have to press the hour and minute buttons repeatedly and of course when you go past your time, you have to go around again. Yes, I'm spoiled, but this thing cost as much as an iPhone, which did lack a lot of features in the first generation, but RoombaÊ 880 is NOT first generation. iRobot, step up your game and at least get some connectivity beyond that insulting remote control, which apparently adds at least $100 to the retail price.6.Ê Admittedly I don't understand the Roomba's movement patterns.It is a mystery. I'm sure it's doing what it's supposed to do. However, if I had a decent iPhone app, I could change its direction if I see the need. I left it running for an hour today, with access to the foyer, master bedroom, hallway and master bath, which has a large rug. When I got home, it was obvious it hadn't made it to the bathroom. The rug had lots of lint and hair visible.7. This is not so much a flaw in Roomba's design as it is a warning: move lightweight lamp cords and other thin wires off the floor, out of its way. On my first day, Roomba pulled a lightweight candlestick lamp off a dresser (It was plugged in behind the dresser, but excess cord was on the floor.) The fluorescent bulb shattered on the hardwood. I was there to stop it from sucking in any glass and mercury, so hopefully no serious harm done. Roomba cannot defy physical laws. It is quite possible for it to drag a cord and cause breakage.PRO:1. My house is so clean! I can't believe how much dog hair and dust it manages to pick up every time. I had run my canister vac over the carpets and swiffered the wood and tile before I let it loose. I can walk barefoot now and feel nothing but smooth floor.2. I'm already breathing better. My allergies aren't gone, but the level of congestion has gone way down.3. I had some sheetrock work in my living room last summer. The contractors didn't properly cover everything, including the HVAC vents and returns, but I thought surely by now all the dust was gone. Let me tell you, the first few full bins were 50% or more sheetrock dust. Every time I've emptied it the HEPA filter has been totally clogged with sheetrock dust. This has been shocking. I'll probably have to hire a company to professionally clean my ductwork, but at least I know.4. I now realize just how much I despise vacuuming -- lugging it around, dealing with the self-tangling 50 ft. cord, having it unplug itself with the slightest pull. Banging into furniture and baseboards.Ê I'll have to use it above the floor to clean upholstered furniture, refrigerator coils, drapes, etc. but...maybe I can find a lighter weight less unwieldy design.5. My back is so happy! So much less bending to get under the sofa and beds and lifting the canister. Yet my floors are super clean. Normally, after cleaning floors I can't stand upright the next morning. Some problems really can be solved by spending a few bucks.6. Roomba is quiet, compared to a regular vacuum! It doesn't even bother the dog, who tears out of the room the minute she hears a regular machine. I can hear the TV or radio while it's in the same room.7. I will not give Roomba up for anything - except the next generation that addresses the above shortcomings. If they come out with a wi-fi enabled model, I'll buy it in a heartbeat.8. Its name is NOMAD, after a space probe from the original Star Trek series. NOMAD had a lot of shortcomings, but much talent and zeal (though somewhat misguided) for it's mission to clean up the universe.9. I find myself becoming interested in cleaning for the first time in my life.Ê NOMAD has made a good start on the dirt, dust and debris. This has inspired me to clean windows, grout, and other things I've ignored."

08/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Four Stars,This Is a wedding gift.Ê I cannot review the robot as the box has not be opened yet.Ê Sorry!
11/27/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I really like this little gadget!!,"This is a terrific little gadget.Ê We have two parrots in our living room, and as parrots are prone to do, they toss seeds, veggies, and feathers all over the area.Ê We specifically bought our Roomba as a solution to this problem, and it works.Ê The Roomba cleans once a day, and if I want it to do an extra clean, no problem.Ê You just grab the remote and click it, and Roomba goes right to work.Ê I often find myself doing this, parrots being how they are.I knew very little about these robots before I bought ours, so this review is geared towards people like myself who know next to nothing about them.Ê Basically, this is a tough, robust wheeled device that bumps and thumps around its designated area in a rather haphazard way, its vacuum cleaner running, until it cleans the area.Ê In practice, even in our cluttered living room when the Roomba is done, the room is clean.Ê However, there is very little apparent order to the way the machine does it -- if you stand around supervising the Roomba it is frustrating.Ê But I find that if I leave it alone to clean the room it eventually does it and returns to its charging station.Ê And the areas around the two bird cages are clean!The Roomba has a lot of suction and it does a very good job cleaning.Ê I was amazed at the stuff that it swept up in our living room.One of the other reviewers complained that the Roomba lacks ""true Artificial Intelligence"" (""AI"").Ê This is both true and untrue.Ê The Roomba does not even pretend to ""learn"" your room, or learn from experience, and it cannot even see anything except the light tower barriers and its docking station.Ê On the other hand, the Roomba has numerous subroutines built in which help it feel along the various surfaces of your room i.e. furniture and other objects, and extricate itself from tight spaces.Ê It also will verbally tell you when it has certain problems.Ê Mine surprised me recently by telling me that I needed to clean its rollers.Ê Turned out it had sucked in a long length of speaker wire.Ê A nice feature.Ê The Roomba also cleans longer or shorter intervals depending on how much crud it is picking up.Ê All of these subroutines combine to create what might be called ""simulated intelligence.""Ê Simulated in the sense that the Roomba sometimes acts intelligently without actually being intelligent. (I hope that this made sense.)The Roomba is very easy to clean and maintain. One of the best design features is the easy access to all of the cleaning areas.Ê Even the rollers are modular and pop right out for easy cleaning. I tend to keep a can of compressed air around to blow out the filter and the innards of the filter module.Ê The filter module snaps right out of the Roomba and is very easy to clean.Ê Replacement filters are available on Amazon or elsewhere and are very easy to replace.Overall I view this device as a success and it is worth the money.Ê I wish that we had bought one years ago.Ê RJB."
11/28/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,This is great,"This is a must if you have a carpet. It cleans very well and does it automatically. It goes all over the place like a retard sometimes, but it still gets the job done."

09/08/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great vacuum!,"This is a great device! The first Roomba I've owned so I can't compare it to other models. It's a very well built system. I particularly like how easy it is to clean. The key places are marked with yellow arrows. The roller system on this unit works very well at picking up just about everything. I've used it on carpet, hardwood and tile with great success. My one comment about using it on carpet is that it pulls a lot of fiber and tends to make a little raft which trips the bin full sensor simply because the raft doesn't drop down in the bin. Also, if there is a lot of hair you need to clean the rollers frequently otherwise it tends to wind the hair tighter and tighter and can cause damage to the rollers. These are easy to clean and easy to replace which Roomba suggests doing fairly frequently for most effective cleaning. It's not particularly noisy but unless you're a deep sleeper you probably can't have it cleaning in an adjacent room during the night. Setting up the virtual wall is very easy and I've never seen the Roomba go past one. I haven't used the lighthouse feature very much, this is supposed to aid multi-room navigation.Being able to run the vacuum and have it return to it's charger is a key feature for us as my wife is sensitive to dust. We can leave the house and come back to a clean room and recharging Roomba. Brilliant!!"
12/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Very Good Choice,This has preformed well over 1500 square feet. we have animals and it picked up all the hair.
6/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Greatest investment for your home!,"This has been the worst season for pet hair in the 10 years that I have had my two dogs and chinchillas. I was vacuuming and sweeping everyday after work and still not keeping up. I didn't want to spend over $600 on a tiny robot vacuum unless this thing did exactly what it said it was supposed to. Guess what? It does exactly what the good reviews say it does. I turn my Roomba on before I leave for work and when I come home the house is spotless! No animal fur rolling around the ground or stuck to the carpet! It is amazing! This vacuum is literally the greatest thing I have every bought for our home. Now when I ask my husband to vacuum he just walks over and turns the ""maid"" on and it's done about an hour and a half later. I wish we would have gotten one sooner. The only thing is watch for cords laying around, it will try to suck those up as well."

1/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,It can clean really good on wood and even better on carpet 2,"This guy is getting 3 stars because 1. It can clean really good on wood and even better on carpet 2. Because it can also scratch wood floors really good. We just bought a new house with brand new floors. And I know exactly where certain scratches were because I hand washed the entire 1st floor. When I got this roomba all of a sudden I was noticing weird circular scratches on the floor. Without a doubt it was the roomba. Only the roomba could make marks that curve like that. So I decided to watch it for an entire sweep one day and noticed exactly when the scratches occured. When it got stuck and started spinning in circles it was scratching the wood floors. Now I wanted automated cleaning but not for the price of a scuffed up floor. Even after putting electrical tape on the caster wheel it still scratched the floors. Thankfully it was within 2 weeks of buying that I noticed this and returned it to Amazon for a full refund. If your house is carpet get this roomba. If it's mostly hardwood like mine, PASS."
06/08/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,WOWÊ What a Great Inv,This device is a godsend. It does work while you are away and does an amazing job. It cleans in between the regular house cleanings and keeps the floors looking like they have just been cleaned everyday. We run our M-F at 10am while everyone is away and it does its thing. When we return we empty the collection tray and it is ready to go the next day. It made a big difference in our household since we have a cat. Keeps him company too. Worth every penny.

6/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,How Did I Live Without It?,"Thie iRobot Roomba 880 saves me from having to push a heavy vacuum cleaner, plus it cleans all the places missed by an ordinary vacuum, such as under the beds and furniture. It is simple to assemble, and it does its job efficiently and quietly. Although some people schedule it to run while they are away from home, I always run mine while I am at home as occasionally its waste paper basket needs to be emptied or it gets itself stuck in a location from which I have to extricate it and switch it to a new location. Picking up a Roomba is a breeze, however, as the robot vacuum is light and it has a neat recessed handle that you lift up when you want to move it by hand. My only quibble is that its waste paper basket is small, and if you have a lot of dust and dirt, you have to empty it frequently. This is not half as cumbersome a job as emptying a bagless vacuum. The Roomba 880 runs for approximately 2 hours when fully charged. If you don't need it to vacuum for this amount of time, you return it to its docking station. Highly recommended for people who hate vacuuming."
05/06/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,LOve It,"There is constant dust in our hi-rise condo due to the way the a/c ducts are configured...more like a commercial building and the ducts cannot be professionally cleaned.Ê We did a major renovationÊ including the demolition of the previous bathroom and sanding hardwood floors which created a lot dust in the ac system.Ê The dust is still a major problem after more than year of living here.Ê The Roomba 880 is just the best.Ê I cannot believe how much dust, dirt, pet hair, and ""stuff"" it picks up.Ê I run it about every other day in different rooms.Ê It has made a huge impact in the reduction of dust in our home.Ê I am buying another one for our farm house which also suffers from lots of dust."

4/25/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Meet the new boss... the best on the market,"The updated Roomba 880 is a definite step up from the other robotic vacuum I have (the Moneual MR6550).Ê While the Moneual vacuum will fall off ledges or stairs, the Roomba will not.Ê The edge detection on this unit will save you a lot of aggravation that you have with a unit such as the Moneual.This vacuum no longer uses brushes to clean the carpet, instead opting for ""Aeroforce Extractors"" that are much better, as they will not collect hair and other things that you will have to manually remove as they get clogged.Ê This is not to say that hair or string will not get wrapped around the extractors, but the removal of these things is MUCH easier with the new design, as it is not stuck in anything, but rather simply wrapped.Ê Just pop the extractors off and slide the hair or whatever off and replace the extractor in the unit.Ê Easy.The new Aeroforce extractors lead to an updated suction mechanism that is extremely powerful.Ê This unit works amazingly well and has a lot of power.Ê Our dog sheds a lot and this thing really cleans up the hair very well.Ê I cannot complain about the performance at all.The unit comes with two navigation cubes that help the robot learn your floor plan and navigate around your house.Ê What is really great is that the cubes work with the Scooba 450 as well, and you can use all the cubes (if you have the Scooba as well) to provide better coverage.Ê These two units work great together and can be used to clean your floor without any effort on your part.This is, without question, the best robotic vacuum on the market.Ê Sure, it is expensive, but, at least in this case, you get what you pay for.BOTTOM LINE: HIGHLY Recommended"
09/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Too expensive for this quality of product!!!,"The unit battery dies too quickly. It goes back to dock after about 20 minutes of cleaning.

07/08/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,The only vacuum you should buy.,"The things this picks up is amazing. I mainly purchased this to pick up dog hair and save us from arguments on cleaning the floors. In the past, we'd have dog hair magically appear all over our clothes and now it would take longer for us to find any on us. It picks up a lot of the standing dust and when we first got it, the tray ran full a couple of times. Now I only need to empty it every 3 or 4 days. It does a pretty decent job on hard floors and an excellent job on carpet.Unfortunately, it can get itself stuck by unintentionally closing doors or under our fridge that has just enough clearance for it to get stuck under. Another con is if you have a dog that isn't potty trained, roomba will go over it (lesson learned). Luckily, we only have 1 dog that is afraid to use the doggy door and his poops are less than an inch. However, cleaning/dismantling this thing was a breeze. They have clear indicators on the unit on what you need to take apart and even use separate colored screws to signify what screws need to come out.I'm considering on buying the scooba or braava based on this purchase."
5/25/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,"Okay, at best","The Roomba works, but for the amount that this one cost, I'd say save your money and buy a cheaper one or a different brand.Ê This Roomba continually and constantly gets stuck on my area rug that is under my dining table.Ê The rug is not long or deep, just a normal area rug about 1/4 to 1/2 inch tall.Ê Being that the dining room in next to the living room, kitchen, and hallways, the Roomba gets stuck every single time it goes out.Ê It's been about a month now, with the roomba cleaning daily, and yep, every day I find it around the rug, stuck behind the couch, or stuck on the bathroom mats.Ê Overall, the technology is cool, but only cool if the darn roomba would back up and unstuck itself."

8/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Cute but not perfected yet,"The Roomba was fun to watch, but took too long to vacuum the floors. It had trouble moving from one carpet to another when it had to cross the wooden floor. After many tries it did finally make it.The dirt bin is too small. It makes an annoying sound since it takes over one hour to do a few rooms.The ""light houses"" didn't always stop it from going to a separate room or stop it from going over the edge of the wooden stairs.I believe it is WAY over priced and the restocking fee of 25% is way too much!"

02/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Love the Roomba 880 v the Neato BotVac 80,"The Roomba 880 replaced my Neato BotVac 80. It's more expensive, but the robotics are much better. First impression is the product quality and ""out of box experience"" is way higher quality than the less expensive Neato. The negatives were smaller dust bin. This is out-weighed by it truly is a robot needing very little human intervention. My Neato always was stuck somewhere and whining. Very high maintenance! The Neto does re-start after a charge, whereas the remote is needed with the Roomba.My Roomba is covering over 2800 sq feet which is impressive. Way quieter and way faster than the Neato..Even little itens like better lights and shipping me a fully charged unit make a way better consumer experience.Great device! I could add some minor features, if they ever want end users feedback!"
10/24/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Roomba 880,"The roomba 880 is rather large didn't think it was going to be big but I like it cleans up pretty well and get all the dust from under furniture. Warning: if your furniture is low it will get stuck,that is the only thing I really don't like because I can't really let it roam free in the living room it needs supervision. Other wise works well great for bedroom I just put in my bedroom close door and let it clean for me. Overall love it great product arrived quickly very easy to put together and use."
05/05/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Remarkable and Much Improved,"The Roomba 880 is much improved over an earlier model I bought a couple of years ago.Ê The new debris extractor roller is a nice improvement which greatly reduces long hair from curling up and clogging things the way it does on most vacuums. On some vacuums I have to spend about 20 minutes with scissors cutting hair off the rollers and brushes...Not so much with Roomba's new debris extractor design.Ê Bravo!The suction is pretty good...though not on a par with a good upright vacuum.Ê You sometimes have some dust particles left on the rug.Ê But, usually, the Roomba does a good job.Ê When you empty the dust drawer, you'll see that Roomba did some pretty good work.A standard Upright causes my back to flare up.Ê So the Roomba is a welcome appliance for anyone who has back issues.Ê You just let it wonder around and clean...while you go about doing something else.Ê The landing on the staircase was a bit dirty, so I left the Roomba on it while I took my daily walk.Ê When I returned, the Roomba had finished, cleaned the landing and turned itself off....very cool.The capacity of the drawer which holds the dust is small.Ê So you have to empty it after each use.Ê But the drawer is easy to clean.Ê The filter sits in the drawer, so it is easy to access and clean as well.There are certain places in which the Roomba will get stuck.Ê For instance, it worked its way into a slot between a bookcase and my dog's crate.Ê Once in this opening, Roomba could not exit.Ê It was stuck and turned itself off.Ê It also got stuck underneath our living room sofa...it could get in, but the top of the Roomba rubbed up against the underside of the sofa, and the poor thing cried for help as it couldn't get out.The Roomba has a timer function so you can schedule when it cleans.Ê But I have not used it.Ê It comes with two virtual walls.Ê A third would be quite useful.Ê These virtual walls are used to block the Roomba from places in which it might get stuck (like under our living room sofa).Ê It would help if the manual accurately depicted the virtual wall so you would know which way to turn it to have it work.Ê But, after a bit of trial and error, I figured it out.When it is done, or when it is getting low on battery, the Roomba returns to its dock..Ê The Roomba comes with a remote.Ê But I did not find it useful.Ê I could never figure out what to press when you simply want Roomba to go back to its dock.Ê Trying to guide it there using the remote is non-intuitive.Ê Easier to just pick up Roomba (which is very light) and place it on the dock.We really like the Hoover Linx cordless vacuum stickÊ It is light weight and works well.Ê The reason I mention it, is that the vacuuming ability of the Roomba is on a par, or perhaps slightly below the ability of the Linx.Ê The Linx is easy enough to move around.Ê The Roomba has the advantage of working without you doing anything after the initial prep.Initial prep you ask?Ê Yes.Ê For Roomba to work efficiently, it helps to move the chairs from under tables, and use the virtual walls to keep the poor guy from getting stuck somewhere.Ê But once you do that prep, you can let Roomba do its work, and watch in amazement.Overall, I'm happy with the Roomba...and amazed by the ingenuity of the product.Ê One last thing I have to mention...the price is really high, and that is probably Roomba's biggest drawback.UPDATE: September 2014 - I upgraded the rating to 5 Stars because the Roomba has taken over the vacuuming chores around the house more than I thought it would.Ê We haven't used a standard vacuum ever since we got the Roomba.Ê It is truly wonderful...no more twisting and injuring my back.Ê The house gets vacuumed every weeks...sometimes twice in a week.Ê Just clear the room, set it, and come back an hour later and the room is done.Ê Highly Recommended."
03/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Love it, Would buy this product again.","The Roomba 880 is certainly a nice upgrade from the Roomba 560. I had the Roomba 560 for around 7 years. Had to replace the battery twice which was 30$. When I saw the Roomba 880 I knew it was possibly time for an upgrade. I purchased the Roomba 880 about 4 weeks ago. I have it setup to clean a 900sq ft apartment every Thursday at 12pm. It has returned to its dock each time, only had 1 issue when it was trying to return but that is it. I placed the virtual wall lighthouse in great spots and it seems to help the Roomba 880 get to where it needs to go. I love the hepa filter in the debris bin that helps collect smaller debris. I also like the new look of the Roomba 880 top deck, also the new rollers are so easy to clean. I am no longer having to cut hair or brush hair out of the Roomba 560 which was time consuming.Now with the Roomba 880, once the debris bin is full I or it needs cleaning I simply empty the debris bin and vacuum the bin and hepa filter with a handheld hepa vacuum. When the Roomba returns to the dock I usually clean out the hair from the rollers, but you just pull the hair out of the roller. No cutting or pulling needed. The remote control sounds like a nice feature but I have not used it yet. The battery in this Roomba is also very impressive. The Roomba 880 seems like it goes forever before it turns red with low battery. Great job iRobot with making the Roomba 880Ê the best robot vacuum around. I have certainly suggested this product to friends and family and also would buy this Vacuum again.Video - iRobot Roomba 880 video showing the Roomba 880 performing its cleaning function.

It will make our lives easier (well, your life anyway)."" I assumed it was alcohol. Later, he admitted he bought a Roomba. I thought $700 for a vacuum was too much. After all, we live in only 500 square feet, and I don't mind vacuuming. At first I was pissed, but then I was kind of excited to see it in action.It arrived fast, even though it shipped directly from iRobot's factory in China. With the press of a button, it chirped to life. After 24 hours of charging, we decided to see what it could do. We had it docked beneath the couch.Ê Assuming that it would be really loud, we braced ourselves for a piercing roar. We pressed ""clean"" and watched it emerge from beneath us. The Roomba floated along, making a rumble low enough that we could still watch TV. We watched it learn the room, going back to the same spots and whipping its whiskers into corners and under furniture legs (seriously!).Our TV stand was like Roomba's Everest. It knew it could do it, it just needed to try. You could almost sense its frustration. After trying multiple points of entry, Roomba pressed down on its wheels to make itself extra compact and glided right under. It recognized the space beneath it as containing lots of dirt, and so it kept going back, crouching, getting stuck, righting itself, until it cleaned the space thoroughly. I had never been able to vacuum under the TV stand. I always had to move the stand, unplugging numerous things from the wall and hating everything.Perhaps even more impressive was its attempt to clean our bathroom. The bathroom door was slightly ajar. Roomba mounted the saddleboard and kept pressing on the door. It really could have opened it, but it seemed to recognize that it was not supposed to go there and backed off.Ê Roomba is ambitious, but it has boundaries.Eventually, it sailed under the bed, easily cleaning out dust-filled corners. 45 minutes later, it returned to its docking station. We were eager to see what it had picked up. I vacuum daily, so I didn't think there would be much in it. We couldn't believe the amount of dust and crumbs in its filter. Not only did it reach places we couldn't with a regular vacuum, it left no area untouched.I will post updates on its long-term performance, but so far, I am really impressed at its robot intelligence, determination and results."

9/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Amazing Vacuum - Give it time to do its thing,"The first few days were a bit of a disappointment for me. I felt like the storage container was not big enough for the dirt it was picking up. After scheduling Roomba to vacuum daily, I love it! It has my concrete and tile floors, carpeted bedrooms and bathroom mats cleaner than they have been in years. I like that roomba cleans under items that I normally can't reach with my standard vacuum cleaner ie. Beds, some chairs, etc. I have found that treating vacuuming as a daily task for Roomba and a once a week for me and my standard vac keeps the apartment in top cleanliness. I have high expectations for cleanliness - dust bunnies, pet hair, grit or grime cannot to be found anywhere. Roomba got trapped 3 times in the last 20+ cleaning cycles. Not bad at all. Especially considering it is cleaning while I am out getting my morning run done or while I am doing laundry or the dishes. Give Roomba some time to work in your home and keep the debris tank emptied. In 1 to 2 weeks you will be amazed. A major time saver!"
8/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,Disappointed after 6 weeks:(,"The first day we used our Roomba was July 8th and we were all very excited. She, we named her Rosie, worked wonderfully for the first 6 weeks and the last few weeks I've been continually disappointed. For the amount of money we paid for this product, I shouldn't have to follow behind it to vaccuum things she misses.Was initially very happy, but now feeling disapointed. We've ready the manual, cleaned the brush heads and filters and nothing seems to make a difference. Hoping for suggestions from the seller."

6/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Much better than 770,The battery does last longer and the new brushes don't get caught on rugs and cords. Also the brushes don't wrap up hair and string like the other models. It cleans very well especially animal hair. It goes under furniture easily and the best thing is its noticeably quieter than the other models. Took a star off because of no real room mapping tech. They do give you a remote to guide it which is a bandaid for now. Come on irobot devs. Get the room mapping tech! People will pay more for it.
4/23/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Improved Roomba 880 vs Neato Botvac 80 vs Neato XV-21,"The actual vacuum part of this Roomba 880 is actually better than previous Roomba models (I have owned four others).Ê The vacuum is still not on a par with the Neato XV-21 vacuum robot (tried one, it broke after four or five days but the vacuum power was IMPRESSIVE!) The new brush-less roller seems to be a great improvement, too.The largest problem with this robot is that the algorithm for movement and motion control still SUCKS!!!!Ê My 880 has been stuck between a chair's legs now for over 45 minutes.Ê I have been watching it just spin right, right, right, right with about 45 degree turns, followed by a couple of 15 degree turns and almost, but not quite line up to get out from the chair but each time the front push sensor taps a leg, it spins 15 degrees right, and cannot make it out.Ê If it would just once turn left 15 degrees (which would seem the logical movement considering it is ALWAYS the very right side edge of the push sensor tapping the leg, the stupid roomba would be free.Ê After about five or six failed rotations to the right, the roomba does do a 'reset' rotation to the left of about 90-degrees, then it starts the failed attempts to the right again.Ê IF the reset was only about 75 degrees rather than a full 90, it would clear itself, too.Ê There are a few very simple little coding procedures that could make this machine far 'smarter' and much more capable.Ê At this rate the battery will be dead before the roomba can freeÊ itself.Ê Here is another place the neato never once found itself trapped.The Roomba 880 does do a much better job a maneuvering around other objects around the rooms it cleans.Ê The Roomba has yet to get 'trapped' on my area rugs like the Neato did frequently.Ê There are black areas on the area rugs where the Neato became 'cliff-scared' and thought it was going into a precipice.Ê This prevented it from always cleaning the area rugs - sometimes it got scared, sometimes it did not.Ê When it did get scared, it just stopped!Ê No backing up, no turning, it just stopped and cried for help.Ê The Roomba is at least smart enough to avoid this pitfall.Ê The Neato had no issues getting up onto the area rug but the Roomba can only manage this if makes a cross-angle approach. If the Roomba attempts to go onto the area rugs straight on, it always fails and turns around.Ê This means that it will not always clean the area rug but so long as it does this at least every other time I use the Roomba, I will be satisfied.I would have kept the Neato over the Roomba because of the vacuuming power but with the complete failure, I decided NOT to replace it but to return it.Ê I read too many complaints of similar failures.Ê I have not tried the newest Neato as it was not available at the time of my Roomba purchase.Ê The flaws may be worked out with the newer model.The Roomba is doing its job for the most part.Ê I have used it about eight times now to clean a very large area.Ê The dust bin is smaller than the Neato.Ê The battery time is shorter.Ê The Neato would restart to finish cleaning after recharging, the Roomba is not this clever.Ê The zone control for the Roomba requires the battery powered little towers, which work.Ê The Neato has a nice concept with the magnetic strip but this did not work right, either, as the Neato did pass right over it at least twice.The verdict, only three stars because of the small dust bin, lack of ability to continue cleaning after a charge and because IT IS TOO STUPID TO EXTRICATE ITSELF FROM UNDER A CHAIR (it has been trapped about 55 minutes now..... pathetic!)Ê It is slowly relocating the chair so it might clean just a bit more of the room before dying.I will keep this vacuum but will some reluctance.Ê It just seems that Roomba could do better with the programming.------------- update ------------When I returned home from work the Roomba 880 was on its charger so it apparently freed itself but it was still trapped at least 70 minutes (when I left for work).Ê Maybe one of my cats freed it?------------- update 2 (25 April 2014) ----------I had originally thought the Roomba 880 was just missing or avoiding my area rugs on occasion because of the short battery life but utilizing the two included Lighthouses, I 'trapped' the 880 into a zone to force it to clean one of the wool area rugs.Ê What I discovered was the Roomba 880 could not properly clean the area rug.Ê It just pushed the dirt, cat hair and dust around.Ê Any debris that was on the new rollers (collected from cleaning the adjacent hardwood floors) was cleaned off the rollers and left as smudges on the area rug. This was not very impressive at all!Ê I am leaving the Roomba 880 at 3 stars but one my primary reasons for buying a robot vacuum was to keep the cat hair from accumulating on the area rugs.Ê The Neato XV-21, while it lasted, did a great job of cleaning the area rugs.Ê Since Amazon is now offering the Neato Botvac, I ordered the model 80 and will see if this does any better.Ê Hopefully the new Neato will last longer than the XV-21 (which I truly believe was a rebuild).Ê Whichever one proves better for my needs I will keep and the other will be gifted to my mom.Ê The Roomba is not so bad as to return, it just fails where I need it most.Ê I think this could be resolved with an actual brush style roller but this is not an option for the new 'superior' Roomba's.Ê (They are both too expensive to justify keeping two robots but I know my mom will appreciate either one of these.)------------- update 3 (12 May 2014)Ê ----------------As promised, here is a comparison/review of the Neato Botvac 80.Ê I cannot say that this Neato is an 'improvement' over the Neato XV-21 because it does not seem to be as powerful a vacuum.Ê But then again, it does seem to have a better navigation program.Ê The Botvac 80 does not clean the area rugs as well as the Neato XV-21 but it does do significantly better than the Roomba 880 on area rugs.Ê The Botvac 80 is much quiter than the Neato XV-21 and, to my ears, seems on a par with the 880.Both the Roomba and Neato machines do an adequate job of keeping the carpets clean.Ê It still amazes me how much dirt both of these machines pick up each day!Ê Both are relatively simple to program.Ê The Roomba is easier to maintain.Ê The dust bin on the Roomba is smaller yet it is easier to clean out.Ê The Roomba filter is easier to clean (I swipe it down with an old tooth brush to remove any residual dust and cat hair.Ê The Roomba filter has a nice little protective screen built in over the filter material that makes maintaining it quite easy.Ê The much larger Neato Botvac dust bin holds significantly more debris but the filter is tougher to pop out (not difficult, just tougher in comparison).Ê The Neato's filter, though, is not at all user friendly in that the dust and cat hair really clings to it and cleaning it off regularly is both necessary and tedious.Ê The new Neato filter is not at all user friendly.Ê Neato 'brags' about the size of their filter, it is much larger than the Roomba filter, but honestly, I cannot see where this is plus considering the limited amount of cleaning these machines can do anyway.Ê I would rather have a filter that is easier to maintain, such as the one found on the Roomba 880.The Neato has a much, much better battery.Ê The Neato battery lasts well over two hours with each charge.Ê The Roomba battery lasts almost exactly 55 minutes with each charge (see update 4, below).Ê The nice thing about the Neato is that it 'measures' the room and if it feels the room(s) has not been completely cleaned by the time it needs to re-charge its battery, then after charging, the Neato will resume cleaning - sometimes two or three times.Ê The bad thing about the Neato is that it will resume after recharging.Ê I actually find this irritating because I work rotating shifts and sleep odd hours; I do not want this machine to start up on its own at odd times of the day to complete the maintenance vacuuming.Ê I am quite happy with the Roomba starting at the same time each day and finishing in 55 minutes.Ê The Roomba may not maintain the entire area but, hey, this is 'maintenance' cleaning, not thorough cleaning.Ê I use t"
04/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,The 880 with the extractors is much easier to clean ...,The 880 with the extractors is much easier to clean and doesn't have to be cleaned as often as the older model 550 that I previously. The hair and threads are so much easier to remove on the 880 and operates longer and quieter.

2/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,The 880 does OK. It cleans the entire room ...,The 880 does OK. It cleans the entire room well. However mine seems to ignore the virtual wall. Also it gets stuck frequently. It rarely finds its way home and when I go to pick it up and place it on the charger sometimes it does not connect. This is my first robot vacuum cleaner and honestly I thought A.I. had come a lot farther since the 80's when my friends were programming dots to find their way out of mazes on a TRS-80. But apparently not.Also it is rather noisy. Not quite as noisy as a regular vacuum cleaner but I find I need to leave the house when it is running.

We have looked at the picture of the rug and we are sorry to inform you that the robot is not able to run on dark surfaces.

5/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Dust Mites and Carpeting Allergens;Ê 880, 770, and Hombot","Summary:Ê The most automated of the 3 high-end HEPA units I've tried.Ê However, its HEPA filtering is less capable and its vacuuming often necessitates a person nearby. Some allergy sufferers nearby still be exposed by vacuuming's dust blowout.Carpet accumulates dust mite and pollen allergens.Ê Constant manual carpet vacuuming is a drag, and even a HEPA vacuum blows out residual allergens and makes misery.Ê My allergy-reduction strategy is robot vacuum 80% of carpet every two days.Ê Then manually vacuum every 10 days to reach the 20% the robots can't.Ê Robotic vacuum cleaners can help prevent allergy shots and pills.I've used 3 HEPA robotic vacuum cleaners:Ê Roomba 770, Hombot 3.0, and this Roomba 880.Ê In summary, Roomba 880 travels smartest. Hombot's HEPA filtering is best, 880 second best.The evaluation criteria of Roomba 880 include:1. How well does Roomba pick up allergens, using the sneeze-nose test?2. How automated?3. Are additional supplies needed?4. How much allergens blowout is created, while babysitting the robot?Unlike many other reviewers, I'm less concerned about how visibly clean the results are, because my carpeting is brown and because my sneezing is accurate on how much dust mite allergens remain.All three robots need the environment to be set up.Ê With the 880, this means, removing small cables, (e.g. USB cables), placing barriers to vibration sensitive devices (e.g. floor standing PCs), removing paper products (e.g. cardboard), rugs, and angled wedges that can trap the robot.After set up, here's how the tests went:1. Picking up allergens:Ê The Roomba 880 does a very thorough job.Ê Far superior to manual vacuuming, but not quite as good as the Hombot.Ê 770 performs poorly on capturing allergens.2. Automation:Ê After the environment is set up, Roomba 880 is fairly automated.Ê All three robots still need babysitting, but the 880 needs the least.3. Extra supplies:Ê Roomba 880 comes with two lighthouses for doorways, perhaps for upto 3 rooms.Ê However, furnishings and walls can create what appears to be doorway entrances to the 880.Ê For example, my elliptical's edge and a wall form an opening about the size of a door.Ê I'm guessing Roomba 880 doesn't like to transverse this opening because 880 may perceive the opening as a doorway.Ê By placing additional lighthouse ($60), 880 then transverses this ""opening"".Ê Replacement HEPA filters cost $8 each (ouch!).4. Allergens blowout:Ê Roomba 880 blows out little allergens, so it is possible for one to stay nearby while 880 vacuums.Ê But I'm highly allergic to dust mites and still am a little sensitive to 880's air blowout, and I wasn't to Hombot's blowout.Overall, this Roomba is fairly automated and its HEPA filtering helps.Ê 5 stars for effective HEPA vacuuming.Ê 4 star for automation.Ê If you want to reduce allergy meds or shots, yes, this will help.6-17-14Ê The HEPA filter and dust bin are small.Ê Needs constantly changing.Ê I found using compressed air helps clean HEPA filter.8-4-14Ê Of the 4 vacuum robots I've used, this is the most automated, meaning it needs less human intervention to escape from being stuck.9-11-14Ê theÊ remote control usually gets confused.Ê Fastest way to change directions-- use robot vacuum's LED panel.Ê Minor annoyance."

It is a tiny circular robot that drives around your house at 1 in the morning or 12 noon when you are not at work and picks up dust, garbage, and hair.I was a bit skeptical at first, but I think it has been doing a fine job in my house for over 3 months now. I have one dog, and hardwood floors. My Rhoomba is a champ at driving around and picking up the hair she sheds all over with great regularity.It isn't a mop, so sometimes I find myself still breaking out the swiffer-wetjet, but man has it made things easier. Plus I have a robot that drives around my house which I think is awesome.If you have an insane amount of dirt in your house (you know who you are) this thing isn't going to change your life.

08/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Have you ever paid full price for a refurbished product?,"So, let's be fair.Ê I ordered and received this unit in October 2014.Ê I never even opened the box until today.Ê Today is 8/8/2015.Ê I am looking at the actual robot and it seems like it looks ""used"".Ê I don't know why.Ê It seems to have minor scratches and the brushes and the other rollers on the bottom have a minor amount of ""grim"" in them.Ê I am keeping the rating at 5/5 for the following reason:Ê It is still recharging.Ê I expect to rate this device fairly after I start actually using a robot vacuum machine thingy such as this.Ê This is just my first initial observation.Ê I am not accusing anyone of anything.Ê Also, I plugged in the virtual walls and put the batteries in the remote control.Ê The time has been set.Ê I tried to get it to clean my place but it just says that it needs to be recharged.Ê I understand.Ê I am patient.Ê More to follow."
12/23/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I HAVE A TON OF ANIMALS AND WOW!! I love it!,"So where do I start. I have two cats who shed like it's their job, two pet rats that love to shove shavings out of their cage, a Jack Russell terrier talk about a major shedding breed, and a horse who's hair some how managed to get in every nook and cranny of the house.Before I purchased the roomba I was vacuuming about every two days which is a lot to do. It wasn't a crazy thorough vaccum but everything I could get without moving furniture. It still wasn't enough not to mention one of the biggest struggles was the bathroom(where we have the litter box) i would have to plant my feet firmly on both sides of the carpet each time and maneuver the vaccum on it, and change the vaccum head to do the tile to get all the litter. Such a major pain. There was always dust around everywhere and I felt like the problem would never go away.I bought the roomba 880 from bed bath and beyond with the 20% off coupon. I love this thing! I was shocked that it did truly do a better job then my 1 year old Hoover vaccum.Ê I have programmed Jeeves(our roomba) to run every day at 10. It's cut back on all the dust the house always looks amazing and it always has a full bin. I love my animals but hated always having to clean up there messes. Now I get to enjoy my animals have a beautiful home and amazingly clean floors. This is a must have for any pet owner truly!!! My life is so much simpler and it goes between carpet to tile to rug like its job. In the bathroom it doesn't even bat an eye to go over the bath mat and then the whole floor!Ê You may think that's a ton of money to spend. But once you have one you understand it's worth every god damn penny!"
01/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Buy two Neato Botvacs instead!,"So we bought both this Roomba 880 and a Neato Botvac at the same time so we could figure out which was better. We were really surprised to find that we love the Neato, and weren't that impressed with the Roomba. The Roomba kinda randomly stumbles around, knocks into things, and doesn't get much stuff up. The Neato maps out a plan, and neatly goes around cleaning the entire floor. It's also has a much stronger vacuum, the Roomba is more of a sweeper. So the Neato takes way less time and actually cleans the house.To put icing on the cake, you can get a Botvac 65 from costco for $300, less than half the price of a Roomba 880. Keep in mind the Botvac 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 are all the same machine, they just include different filters to charge different prices at different stores. Buy the least expensive, you can swap out filters anytime you want. We ended up returning the Roomba and buying two Neato Botvacs instead."

5/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,So far so good.,"So I've had this roomba about 2 1/2 weeks.I'm running it 4 times a week. It does a good job. I have a small living room (carpet) and kitchen/dining (wood) area that it does.One time it stopped in the living room. Like it lost its way and ran out of battery. Everything was clean, though.I wish it was a bit more intelligent. I wish it would be a less random, but at the end of the day it does everything and well. I haven't seen missed spots yet, so I'm happy.I have never had a cleaning robot, so I am curious to see how long this lasts for the price."
12/26/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,I expected more.,"So I bought this after reading reviews and I thought it would be great but it just runs around the house randomly bumping into things and getting stuck. I don't know if it is defective or something but it is pretty annoying. I set it to automatically start at 9:00 AM, it is now 12:33 PM and I have had to get it unstuck 3 times and it is just walking around the house like a drunken sailor. I have hit return to base 3 times but it refuses to go back. I have yet to figure out what pattern if any it is trying to use. Seriously thinking about sending it back, for almost $600 I expected more."

08/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,I <3 robots !,"So far so good!Pros:*We have a short hair pit bull mix and surprisingly this dog loses hair constantly. I couldn't believe the amount of hair this roomba picked up from the wood floors and carpeted office area where my dog hangs out during the day. I'll take pics later. I was astounded and how clean the carpet and floors are after the robot has it's way. I'll have a Rottweiler pup in another month which is another reason we bought this. I don't regret the purchase at all.*Easy to program.*Very sturdy, well designed.*Plenty of space in the tray unless you live in an absolutely filthy environment.*Not as loud as I thought it would be.Cons:*Can't navigate around chairs when under the dining room table. Gets a bit confused.*The lighthouses/virtual walls don't seem to work that well. The roomba glides right through the virtual wall after appearing to recognize and turn back a couple times. A video on how to set these up effectively would be nice."

8/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,All Hype But No Performance,"So disappointed.Ê I bought this to replace a very good Iclebo whose only fault was having brushes that I hated cleaning.Ê The 880 has rubber blades/fins that eliminate the need to touch disgusting pet hair, etc. while cleaning brush.Ê From what I can tell, this is its only advantage.Ê Sadly, this 880 didn't follow the program.Ê It sort of cleans at will - even starting up at 1 am a few times.Ê Also, it gets lost all too frequently - and often in the same place.Ê It is NOT smart.Ê The Iclebo is much more ""intelligent"" about cleaning and finding its way back to the charger.Ê This 880 seems obsessed with cleaning a certain area while ignoring a tuft of pet hair just inches away.Ê Many times it refuses to cross the threshhold into the kitchen - and no barriers either electronic or physical are stopping it.Ê Right now, it's just sitting in the middle of the floor with no obvious reason to have stopped there.Ê With all the good reviews, maybe this particular machine is defective - and it is being returned, considering the steep price.Ê On to the next robot vac, but it will not be a Roomba."
8/24/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,half short carpet home so I pooped for the 880 and glad I did 10 months ago,"Single guy here who likes a clean house but with 2 long haired dogs and a cat not to mention dirt I track in (I live on a small farm) in my half hardwood, half short carpet home so I pooped for the 880 and glad I did 10 months ago.I'd been watching the Roomba reviews for years and held off until the 880 came out before I spent the money.Ê so...It picks up everything from dust, lots of gritty dirt and wasps (I tend to leave my door open a lot for fresh air).Ê Bumble bees and large dead moths are beyond it's capabilities but they are few and far between inside.Ê My small dogs have very fine hair which tends to clump up on the carpet and while my Roomba 880 gets every bit on the hardwood it doesn't pick up the smaller clumps of fine dog hair off the carpet.Ê Not a big deal to spent 1 minute a week to grab them by hand.I've got a small air compressor and thus far the original Roomba filter is still going since I blow it out every 3-4 cleanings.Ê I've had to replace the brushes twice in the last 10 months since they sometimes loose one of the arm's bristles.Ê Once again not a big deal and a easy job.Ê This ""vacuum"" was clearly designed for easy maintaince.Today I heard a louder than normal noise as it ran.Ê Upon inspection I saw that one of the rollers had been cut through by a wrap of fine dog hair.Ê Since the rollers are so easy to clean (something I do about once a month and takes 1 minute) I ordered a replacement roller (sweeper) set .Bottom line is while I wouldn't call the Roomba ""intelligent"" (It bumps too many table legs) I'm very satisfied with the labor the Roomba 880 saves me every day."

Buying the Roomba has been one of the ...,"Simply amazing.Ê Buying the Roomba has been one of the best purchases I have made in years.Ê We have two dogs, one of which sheds constantly.Ê This meant that unless we vacuumed a few times a week we would have dust and hairballs throughout the house.Ê The Roomba runs nightly and we essentially have no more dog fur issues.Ê In particular I think the fact that it can get underneath furniture that we miss with an upright has made a huge difference.Ê On our first floor we have hardwood and persian rugs only which the Roomba does very well with.Ê The second floor is carpeted which admittedly the Roomba has a much harder time with.Contrary to what I had read, the Roomba seems to be able to handle a pretty large amount of space.Ê Our first floor is ~1250 sq ft.Ê With the virtual lighthouses we can focus the vacuum on the main room that we spend our time in and it does a good job with the less trafficked rooms.I spent a great deal of time agonizing over wether to drop so much money on a vacuum.Ê It really has replaced my upright which we only need to use now once a month.Ê So long as you do not have carpet I highly recommend"

7/27/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Roomba 880 VS. iClebo Arte VS. Neato Botvac 80,"Short answer: the Roomba 880 does the best job cleaning. I bought all three and tested them all over 2 weeks and 2 houses. The 880 charges faster, is easier to pickup and move around (it has a handle!!), is built with higher quality components, and the virtual walls are superior to the magnetic strips. The iClebo Arte sounded like it was going to fall apart.Ê Compared to the 880: think USA made vs Chinese made quality (Yeah I know iClebo is South Korea but you get my point) The Neato Botvac 80 is 2x as heavy as the 880, and the battery life is not nearly as good - in reality it probably has the same battery milli-amp-hours as the 880 (not sure but guessing) but since the Neato has a much more powerful vacuum than the 880 it burns through the battery a lot faster. Here is why you want the 880 for cleaning (and you'll be surprised by my answer) First a robotic vac does not have the same suction power as a plug in vacuum. Robotic vacs are really for maintenance. We have house cleaners every 2 weeks but I also have 7 and 9 year old boys and I a 40 year old male love to cook. So after the maids leave the house is dirty in 10 minutes and trashed in 24 hours. So having a push button robotic vac I don't have to con into cleaning the floors daily is well worth it. Also, when you get the 880 vacuum it looks like a robot with ADHD. It's almost maddening watching it. See when I vacuum I start from the left and move to the right in straight lines and I apply that logic to the robotic vac (as if I know better than a machine... silly me) but you will soon realize that when you hit a dirty spot from every direction possible (like the 880 does due to it's ADHD) it actually cleans better and more thoroughly than the iClebo and the Botvac 80 both of which can do the random ADHD as well as the anal straight line cleaning we are all too familiar with. I want the highest quality vac I can get with great cleaning and a good power vs battery life balance. The 880 fits the bill and does the best job."
07/10/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Shedding Dog makes getting a Roomba an easy decision,"Shedding dog=get a Roomba. My life is easier now that I have my Roomba, Many more positives than negatives,Pros: Programmed easy, navigates well, picks up enough hair for two dogs, pretty intelligent pattern, my dog is used to it now after two weeks, cleans out easy, charges in it's stand under a table out of sightCons: Gets stuck under my kitchen cabinets occasionally and shuts down. Battery life could be better but it seems good enough for what we use it for, we could theoretically have it vacuum twice a day while we are away, occasionally we have to carry it home to it's dock because of where we put the charging dock, a bit noisy but way less than the average vacuum, price was steep but over time should be worth it,I WOULD buy this product again knowing what I do now about it"

9/30/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"We love our ""Ruby""!!!","She keeps our hard wood floors free of pet hair and dirt from their paws! Before we got her, even with me sweeping every other day, you could still see little balls of fur rolling across my hardwood like little tumble weeds. I have her clean the main hall, living/dinning room, and kitchen everyday. About once a week I will put her in a bedroom and close the door and let her go to town. I haven't had to sweep or vacuum in month. The instructions say to change the hepa-filter once every 2 months but I bought extra due to the excessive pet hair and am planning on changing it every month. Filters are cheap though. I would definitely recommend this product."

4/21/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,A worthwhile splurge,"Rosie the Roomba joined us a little over a month ago, and I am thrilled and appalled with the amount of cat fur, dust, and other nastiness she removes from our floors. She runs every day downstairs, and this increased vigilance means no more cat fur tumbleweeds clinging to the bottoms of my kitchen cabinets or lurking beneath my china cabinet. Most days I take her upstairs in the afternoon and let her do a few rooms up here too. I work from home, and can easily work and be on conference calls even with her upstairs. Shes not all that loud, mostly a monotonous hum that the cats find a mild curiosity. I do hear her thudding into things, usually my kitchen chairs. But she gets all crumbs off my kitchen floor, without any intervention from me.Ê We have berber carpet, ceramic tile, hardwood, and area rugs. She does sometimes miss something on the highly polished hardwood, but shell get it the next day. My baseboards arent furry any longer either.Cat hair. Ah cat hair. We have two enormous, furry, long-haired Maine Coons. Shedding season is here, and theyre blowing their coats. Overnight the carpet sprouts fur. To add insult to injury, the house is on the market, and people want to walk through on short notice and track debris through my home. The Roomba eliminates the stress, and the mess. Running her every single morning downstairs means the carpet is the cleanest its ever been. Ive debated getting little risers for my couch so she can easily get under it - just not quite enough clearance.Ê Cat hair does not get stuck in the rollers. Cat hair does wrap around the inside edges of themÊ where you pop them out for a weekly cleaning. It slides right off and into the trash. It takes me 3 minutes for the weekly maintenance.Ê Think about that. It takes longer to go get the Dyson out of the closet and unwrap the cord and plug it in. (Which I had to do for the stairs.) I adore my Dyson. I really do. It does a fabulous job. But I like not having to use it every few days even more.Ê And why did the Roomba fill up fast on the first time on a floor just swept with my Dyson? I was horrified.Our house may be an optimal design for a Roomba. I loathe clutter, and theres very little on the floors to impede operation of a robot. (No kids here = only a few cat toys.) I do close the bathroom door because bath rugs get dislodged by the Roomba, and there could be moisture, which is fatal to a Roomba.Ê I protect the cat food/water by keeping it in a plant/boot tray instead of using a lighthouse. It was $6, and also keeps cat-made messes inside the tray and away from the Roomba (water=death). The Roomba bumps the tray, even skews it at times, but all is safe.Ê The Roomba deals well with the rather high threshold from the living room to the ceramic tile. It also unsticks itself from the living room curtains that just drag a few inches on the floor. It also untangled itself from a cell phone charging cord. It did turn off my surge protector by smacking squarely into the kick button in front (oops). Ive relocated that to the bottom shelf of our office bookcase. It returns to the dock every day, unless it gets stuck under the edge of the coffee table, which is just at the height clearance. Im still working on ways to fix that issue.As designed, the Roomba does an excellent job, and most days I let it go, unattended. I do find that with a little prep from me, it can do an amazing job. I invested less than 5 minutes clearing the floor in my sewing room this morning, and will let the Roomba loose this afternoon to thoroughly vacuum the floor, and not worry about thread tangling or anything else it might pick up. Since I only do that room once a week or so, its worth the time to prep. I also keep my cord clutter contained and behind furniture, off the floor, so I am sure that helps. Did I mention that it goes in the closet, under my clothes, without a hitch?The cons:- Price. OUCH.- Plastic feels a bit flimsy for something this expensive.- Virtual walls require C batteries. Seriously? They drink batteries. Ridiculous. I deal with this with a set of rechargeable batteries and a good charger. Upstairs I often close the robot into a room with (gasp) the door, until it finishes, rather than use walls with batteries.- Should come with 3-4Ê lighthouses rather than virtual walls at this price point.- Only comes with 2 filters at this price point. When you register it on the site, youll get 2 more free as a gift. I swap mine out once a week and thoroughly rinse them out. They must be ABSOLUTELY dry before you use them.My conclusion?I love her. Really deeply love her. I loathe vacuuming. Its tedious and mindless, and there are so many things Id rather do. Out of the box it works very well. With a little assistance it can really keep your home cleaner. I'd give it 4.5 stars, but since I can't, I'll go 5."

I bought it for the new house because we are slowly unpacking and right now there isn't a lot of time to vacuum. I let him loose in the bedrooms and he picks up quite a lot of stuff. A couple minor quibbles: The bin is a little small, the light comes on after 10 minutes and he gets hung up under furniture."
3/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,In use every day,"Roombina, as we affectionately call her, works every day at our house, sweeping under the bed, in the corners, and especially concentrates on wherever the cat is lying at the moment. My husband has worked out the method for each room and delights in sitting at his computer and watching her work.Ê We rarely use the lighthouses any more - we purchased three long pieces of baseboard from Home Depot and set those up as walls instead of the virtual walls.Ê Roombina has very little trouble with rug fringe, but can't manage the height/fringe combination of two rugs stacked one on top of the other.The first run on our living room rug required NINE empties of the dirt bin.Ê With almost daily runs over the last month, we are down to 1.5, and hoping to get down to one.Ê The house in general seems brighter and doesn't require dusting as often.It took the cat about a week to completely ignore Roombina - but she still watches carefully if she is laying on the carpet!Ê :)We have had absolutely no trouble with Roombina so far, but will update the review as necessary."

2/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,"Fun, functional, time saving, good with xmas tree needles","Roomba is nice to have around. I have never owned a robot vacuum before. In a nutshell, I've experienced the same as all the other reviewers to an extent, I've owned him now since Nov2014 and I can't really add much although I will elaborate or confirm what other reviewers have said.Apologies to amazon but I did as others recommended and signed up for the bed bath & beyond 20% off coupon and bought from them for the discount. So easy and over $100 savings.I have a 3 person household and 1 english setter w/ fine silky hair, short to medium length and it picks up well except for some of the dog's longer 'feathers'. It does however collect the feather hair and wind them into yarns that are easily picked up from the carpet once he's done vacuuming.When you first purchase and use, his bin needs emptied frequently. It's helpful to have another vacuum to suck out the extra dust and debris from the bin and especially the filter but if this is not practical, a swiffer hand duster is awesome as well. I empty the bin in the garage because it's a dusty process.I haven't run my 15 year old hoover wind tunnel since I got roomba. I have a 1500 sf ranch with a basement level that contains another approximate 1100 sf finished in mostly carpet. Upstairs 1500 sf is about 60% hard laminate with throw rugs, the rest normal pile synthetic carpet. Like some have said, Roomba is not efficient in his erratic pattern so quite often I just sweep w/ a broom my hard floor and shake the throw rugs which is a 15 min process at best, Roomba would take 1.5 hours to get this properly. Some say he gets stuck on rugs with a dark patch as if it's a dirty area; I have a tri-colored Brazilian cowhide that I suspect Roomba gets stuck with sometimes.Ê I prefer to turn him loose on the regular carpeted areas. I do like his `spot' clean function, when I sweep my hard floor I pull the crumb pile into an open area and let him suck it up instead of me and a dustpan doing the rest of the job. Very helpful...and more fun.Furniture/clutter staging is required, thicker throw rugs need to be folded in 1/2's or 's and certain tight spots need blocked off. You learn quickly when he gets stuck to the point of stopping where to prep at. I've never had an issue with him falling over the steps.My favorite thing when we first got him... got his battery charged and everyone was excited to see him in action, I turned him loose in my bedroom first and he promptly disappeared under my bed for the next 25 mins! Son was so disappointed but the underneath of my heavy bed set is no longer a dust bunny/allergen breeding ground...he hits it hard under the furniture if he can fit.I notice on our synthetic carpet that he does pick up carpet fiber. When I empty the bin it seems that alot of the debris is carpet fiber as much as dog hair. This seems to have reduced, but we've had this carpet now for almost 9 years so it's bound to have loose fibers. It's not like the carpet looks as if it's going bald, it's just nice to think that loose debris like this is getting pulled up.I don't have the patience to run Roomba with the lighthouses/virtual walls. I followed other various reviewers comments to just let him run free through a room or if you want him to focus on 1 room, put him in there and shut the door for a certain period of time. I thought I had these devices figured out but then Roomba behaved counter intuitively to my understanding and I threw my arms up. I don't program my Roomba to run daily while we're gone either, this isn't necessary in our home, we're not that dirty. Our dog is also mature and has had recent health issues that has caused messes on the floor and I don't want to have the situation that one reviewer mentioned where it ran through one of the messes and spread it through their home.I enjoy working with Roomba as a team, only using him when I'm home and controlling his work area. He's fun to run while you're cleaning other things or just drinking a beer watching him; its satisfying when he eliminates the need for me to vacuum while I dust or clean bathrooms. He cuts down a lot on cleaning effort and I got rid of my hired house cleaner when I got him...he'll pay for himself in less than 5 mos.He fascinates my mechanically inclined husband, he can't take his eyes from him as he whizzes through the room. The dog doesn't trust him but understands that Roomba isn't deliberately chasing him; he just likes to be sure he's not in the same room that Roomba is cleaning. I like things clean and I feel that the only time I'll have to get the regular vacuum out is when I need to get behind furniture and cobweb corners. Roomba picks up well overall and doesn't get bothered with my long hair. I think in the winter he helps keep our allergen/asthmatic aggravations at a lower level. I run him every weekend in our carpet rooms and then once he's charged I run him through the same rooms again. As another reviewer mentioned, he's an all-terrain vacuum vehicle, don't worry that he'll get stuck unless it's an honest obstacle.I can be a control freak but I giggle when I see his random `pinball' pattern that he leaves on the carpets. Roomba takes on this enormous vacuum job for me, to hell what his cleaning pattern turns out looking like - I love it!In summary, I give Roomba 4 stars because he's not perfect but damn close to it. He's not efficient on the hard floors in my opinion (but I'm impatient) and his bin needs emptied frequently at first. I see that he's not picking all of the dog hair out of our carpets but it's better than I could do with my upright vacuum with the time I have to myself and I'm not the one vacuuming. He's charming and sincere and strives to please. He's entertaining to clean house with. He's been durable, I haven't had any defective part problems or breakdowns. Oh, and he did an excellent job spot cleaning after I pulled the xmas trees out of the house, he was a spruce tree needle monster machine. I don't regret this purchase and I would make it again. It's like your dishwasher or laundry machines...you could be standing at a sink or tub and hand washing every piece yourself or you can just push start and tell Roomba to happily do it again for you!"
7/26/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Nice helper!,"Roomba has come a long way. I bought one of the first generations ages ago and it was fair. My family and friends made fun of me because I bought it. Ironically, my daughter bought a Roomba recently and raved about it to me--hmmmshe was one of the biggest skeptics when I bought the first one. I've followed her advice to try again and a month ago purchased the Roomba 880 and am amazed at how far it has come. I know I will still need to pull out ye olde vacuum now and then for certain dirt. The Roomba cannot delve into deep corners. I'm impressed with how long it will work. We have two collies and a long haired cat and it has no problem with the pet hair that blows around the house. Under the bed it goes to tackle dust bunnies. Picked up loose kitty litter that was on the floor. One great thing about this way of cleaning is that it organizes me. We have mostly hardwood floors, hard tile bathrooms and porch, some wall to wall and a thick carpet in one room. It has handled all situations so far. When you first get it you will waste time watching it but that'll pass. I mowed the lawn while Roomba was vacuuming--quite rewarding."

10/07/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Best Cleaning Combination!,"Review is for the Roomba 880 and the Braava 380tSetup: 1200 feet of hardwood flooring, 600 upstairs, 600 in basement.Ê Upstairs black bamboo with brown highlights, downstairs dark brown laminate.I've had both of these for about 6 weeks now.Braava 380t: I bought this first and used it for dusting and mopping.Ê Since buying the Roomba 880 I no longer use this for dusting.As long as you understand how it works you'll love it.Ê The Braava has a reservoir which you fill with water and you attach mopping pads onto it (I have bought 9 additional pads).Ê There is also a GPS device that comes with it that keeps track of what was mopped.It's not perfect, especially if your room configuration is not typical.Ê I have to do 2 moppings with mine, but it does a great job at mopping.Ê I probably mop both floors twice a week, as traffic shows up on dark hard wood pretty quickly.Ê The reason I stopped using this for dusting, dark/black flooring shows all the dirt, and since this machine isn't a vacuum, it isn't going to pick it up.Ê So I bought the Roomba 880.Roomba 880:Ê Comes with 2 virtual walls which are completely necessary if you have more than 400-500 square feet and if your room configuration isn't typical.Ê I have to divide my room with a virtual wall and do one at a time, otherwise, the whole 600 ft area won't be cleaned (it cleans for an hour).Ê It moves fast and does a great job picking up dirt.Ê The bin is big enough, I love the fact you can program it for each day of the week.Having both products, we no longer have to vacuum or mop.Ê There are places these can't get to so once in a while we have a hand vacuum we use for those.Ê The time saved by using these products is immense and I can't imagine not having either of them.They aren't perfect (no machine/computer is) but once you figure out how they think and get used to them you won't be able to live without them."

It uses the same pattern to try to get out which means it just hits the same spot on the stool legs until the battery runs outNeeds to be reprogrammed constantly -Ê if it gets stuck in the stool, it will twirl around until battery runs out. If battery runs out, it looses the time and the clock needs to be set again. This should have an extra backup battery used jut for the clock."

12/16/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Disappointed with performance and value,"Pro's - Great build quality, relatively quiet, does well on hardwood and tile.Con's - 1.Ê Does not cover 100% of the room.Ê The ""random"" pattern is just that, random regardless of what the manufacturer says.Ê I have watched and videoed to verify that it doesn't cover all of the room.Ê 2.Ê Will bypass the hallway to the rear of the house about 50% of the time, regardless of how I setup the lighthouses.Ê Even moved the docking station to the rear and it rarely made it out of the back bedrooms to the front of the house. 3.Ê Poor suction - this is really nothing more than a glorified sweeper with a little suction.Ê Only gets the surface of carpet.Ê 4.Ê Frequently fails to make it back to the docking station.Ê I even have purchased extra lighthouses so that no matter where it goes, it has contact with a lighthouse, each lighthouse can see at least one other lighthouse, and one lighthouse sees the docking station.Ê No lighthouse is closer than 10' to the docking station.Ê The lighthouses are set in a pattern that should allow it to cover each room in sequence.Ê Get the same result no matter how few or how many lighthouses are used.For what this is, it's extremely overpriced.Ê I was well aware of the ""intelligence"" of the unit before I purchased but took into account all of the reviews.Ê When it works, it does an ok job.Ê But it rarely works as it's supposed to.Ê For the price, I would expect more performance, more intelligence and the ability to autonomously perform it's function instead of having to have constant intervention to keep it on track.Ê Would not buy again knowing what I know now."
06/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Awesome!,"Pricey, but worth it. Was skeptical for a long time on cleaning robots, but it does a great job. Gets a little hung up going back and forth under our kitchen table, but makes it out of there. It has 8 chairs in a small space so a lot of legs to bump into so I can't get too upset. Means it stays cleaner under there. Doesn't cover every spec of the floor each time it runs, but will over the course of several days. Highly recommend."
4/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,"solid, not spectacular","Pretty solid.Ê For the price point, you'd expect this product to be life-changing, but alas, it's pretty average.Ê It will pick up most obvious particles, but it does need to be cleared of tangled hairballs regularly.Ê Just dump out the filter after each use, and the product will work satisfactorily.Ê If you expect this to replace your human standard, however, be prepared to be disappointed."

8/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Pretty Good,"Pretty good but might be a bit overpriced. The 880 does an excellent job of maintaining our hardwood and slate floors but has some quirks that keeping it from being a set and forget device. If you have only one room to vacuum you can probably set it on a schedule and just let it do its thing on the schedule and have the room kept cleaner than you could keep it with a traditional vacuum. But with two or more rooms it occasionally gets confused. It will sometimes clean one room and go back to base forgetting the other rooms (might be a lighthouse thing - they seem to work sometimes but not others). It will sometimes clean all rooms then return to the first room and clean it for an extraordinary length of time until the battery dies. Most of the time it does all rooms and returns to base like it is supposed to. But if you get it going and leave, when you come back and it is in its dock you don't know what rooms it has actually cleaned. Also, it has understandable problems with regular doors - like bedroom doors. It will come in contact with the edge of the open door and spin, thus closing the door some. It then runs into the partially closed door completely closing it and locking itself in the room. We don't find it makes that much noise so we simply run it when we are home and in the back of our minds keep up with what rooms it has done and get it back on the proper course as needed."

11/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Poor performer for the price,"Poor performer for the price. After it finishes cleaning my tile floor, I have to go through the house with a swiffer to finish the job. The photo shows what is leftover. (I run it once a day. Seems like there shouldn't be this much left behind on a small tile floor.) I gave it 3 stars because it DOES clean some dirt, but save your money... Swiffer (or similar-type sweeper) will be much cheaper. I'm hoping to return this product."

This guy will treat any rug more than 0.3 inches tall as a WALL which makes it almost useless to clean rooms with rugs. Not only does it fail to clean the rug, but it also walls itself off from all the carpet space BEYOND the rug, UNLESS it gets super lucky and climbs the rug at a shallow angle, which is rare.Also, did no one else notice that the startup song for ""Clean"" is identical to the Windows 7 startup song?

5/30/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,We love Rosie!,"Our Roomba was named Rosie after the helper bot from The Jetsons.Ê I purchased ours direct from iRobot because at the time it wasn't available from Amazon yet.We have 7 kids (some with allergies) and 2 dogs in our house, so it is a very busy place and it can get hard to keep up with the housework no matter how hard my wife works at it.Ê Rosie has been a blessing!Ê We can ask the kids to clear the room, pick up toys, shoes, books...etc and then let her go.We prefer to ""prep"" the room before she goes, so we haven't messed with the automatic scheduling much.Ê In our dining room, we'll move all of the chairs and stuff to one side and let her go under half the table and open space, then switch it around to ensure she gets to it all.Ê She works great around table legs, over rugs (some are pretty shaggy too!), and stairs.We use the virtual walls all the time, the work very well to keep Rosie in the space we want her to work in.Ê We have only used the lighthouse feature a few times and it seems to work just fine.I love that it doesn't have the brushes like most vacuums use.Ê With 3 daughters, I'd expect to find hair wrapped around the brushes all the time, but the rubber brush-like mechanism doesn't seem to pick up nearly as bad as our old Shark.My one issue is that it doesn't get perfectly into corners, but that is an easy fix when she's done.Rosie helps us get the floor vacuumed more regularly, which was our ultimate goal.Ê 5 minutes of prep, let her go and then move on to something else while she does her thing.Ê The Roomba 880 does a great job of picking up dirt on our floors, which range from Frieze carpet to tile, to hardwood and rugs.Ê It doesn't have the battery life to clean an entire 2000 sqft house without recharge, so if that is your requirement you'll be disappointed.Ê We can have it clean a few of our rooms in a row before having to get her back to her base.This thing is a must for busy families that would rather spend their time on things other than vacuuming."

Good at picking stuff up off of hard surfaces and low pile carpet, little more tentative on area rugs with more of a nap. Easy to operate. Definitely glad that we made the purchase. Does not completely replace having to bring out regular vac cleaner for a more heavy duty cleaning, which I can do monthly now instead of weekly. Makes me smile!"
8/18/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,One of my favorite things,"Our household includes three cats, a large dog, two humans, two turtles, and a bearded dragon.Ê There is a lot of work to be done to keep everyone healthy, happy, and clean.Ê I can't imagine life without Rosie, my Roomba.Ê She isn't perfect but the convenience of getting a decent vacuuming done at a scheduled time EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK makes her few shortcomings easy to overlook.Ê And having that major chore out of the way has really motivated me to keep an even cleaner house than I did B.R. (before Roomba).Because the marketing and other reviews more than adequately cover the pros of owning a Roomba, I'm only going to hit on a few of the cons in this review.Ê Please keep in mind that, overall, the pros far outweigh the cons for me.Ê This isn't meant to be a negative review at all.Ê I just think it's important to know what sort of caveats to expect if you're considering joining the Roomba owner's club.*Getting Trapped Under Things:Ê I have a low couch that Roomba has just enough clearance to get under.Ê There is a spot where the slight sag sometimes traps Roomba.Ê The solution is to wedge something under that spot to prevent Roomba from getting there or to find a way to raise similar furniture (Amazon sells taller replacement couch feet, for instance).*Avoidance Of Black Floors:Ê I had a large rug with black patterns on it.Ê Roomba's infrared edge sensors can't differentiate between cliffs and black floors so it would go unvacuumed.Ê I modded my Roomba so that it was blind to edges.Ê It wasn't difficult but it isn't something I'd recommend for most people.Ê I wasn't that dedicated to the rug so now it is rolled up in storage and I've reversed the modifications.*Inability To Navigate Out Of Tight Spots:Ê On the wide side of my dining room table's barstools, the legs are just far enough for Roomba to get in between them and get stuck.Ê As soon as it bumps into a leg, it starts turning and testing different directions.Ê Unfortunately, it never quite lines up with the path it took to get under the stool and eventually runs in circles until the battery dies.Ê My solution has been to turn the barstools 90 degrees so the narrow ends point out and Roomba never gets under them.Ê Of course, that looks a little funny and it means no vacuuming gets done under the table.Ê Similarly, Roomba would sometimes push my bathroom trashcan back and then get trapped between the wall and the side of the toilet.Ê I now keep a little gravel in the bottom of the trashcan to prevent Roomba from being able to scoot it back.There you have it.Ê I love my Roomba.Ê I am constantly amazed at the type and quantity of stuff that gets picked up every day.Ê Maintenance is fairly straight forward and not overly costly.Ê As soon as iRobot can make a more automated, schedulable mopping robot, I'm in.Ê And I'm especially looking forward to the invention of a dusting robot."
12/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Picks up dust and dog hair even after I vacuum,"Our house is frequently vacuumed with a Dyson animal vacuum. It was still difficult to keep up with two labs who seems to shed year round. The roomba 880 was a perfect solution to our problem. Set to run every day and sometimes twice a day, ""Benson"" as we named it collects dust and dog hair from under the furniture that is often missed in a normal vacuuming cycle. The bin is small and I find myself emptying it two or three times on a normal cycle which is somewhat of an inconvenience but then I'm still amazed with what it's collected each time. It's not a complete replacement for regular vacuuming but it definitely cuts down on the need to do it as frequently. We have also figured out two two pieces of furniture it gets stuck trying to go under and the one small bathroom that can trap it if it swings the door shut. Otherwise, I'm a huge fan!"
4/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Simply amazing,Our home is almost fully carpeted (except for kitchen and bathrooms). My fear was that Roomba will not work that great on carpets. But looks like Roomba 880's claim of 50% more dirt extraction is accurate. This is our first Roomba so I can't compare with previous versions but overall I am impressed. It helps to Roomba proof your home but Roomba doesn't get stuck on cables and wires etc. It might knock off things like flower vase if it is not stable or not heavy enough. Roomba 880 cleans well and covers the area well (it may look random but it covers the room including edges quite well). Another benefit is that it can go under beds and sofas etc. It does make some noise but I am fine with that as I run it in the room where no one is there or schedule it when no one is at home. Now can Roomba replace my Dyson upright? I think it can for the most part. I like the feeling when I ask Roomba to do the cleaning and I read a book. Cleaning debris bin is a chore but once you start using Roomba daily or almost daily you won't have to do that that often. Cleaning debris bin releases some dust in the air so that is a problem just like other vacuums. Roomba 880 is pricey but there is a mother's day 15% discount going on currently so may not be a bad deal. Ongoing expenses for parts like HEPA filter etc. is not that bad from what I can tell (there are 3rd party non-iRobot parts available too). I got 880 as it is the latest model that allows you to direct Roomba to more than one room.

8/25/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,this machine is amazing and has changed my life,"Other than getting hung up occasionally on a threshold, this machine is amazing and has changed my life. I have two dogs and a large cat that shed leaving fluff in all corners and edges of the walls. No more!! Very, very happy customer."
10/31/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,great in principle. lacking execution.,"Originally the 770 but found that the brushes and dog hair don't work well together.Ê as noted in others feedback, this was quite challenging to clean.Ê In principle really helpful but not so if you have to keep cleaning.Ê Sooo, returned to amazon and bought the 880.Ê The 880 is much better. they use rubber rollers instead of brushes.Ê This seems to clean better but also seems to pull up carpet fabric.Ê not sure.trash bin gets filled up faster, and we could not get the sensor to go off.Ê so even when empty it reported full.Ê Then the wheels began squeeking. since it is a closed system, there is nothing to lubircate.Ê irobot suggested we return. which we did. now upgraded to the 980. who's the fool here. hopefully that will work. so far not sure. its a bit noisier."
12/28/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,While my rugs are nice and have pads below,"Only buy if you have fully carpeted floors or wood/tile WITHOUT area rugs.Ê It would NOT transition from hardwood floor to an area rug, making it absolutely ineffective in my home.Ê While my rugs are nice and have pads below, they are not high shags or thick such that I would have expected the Roomba to treat the rug like a wall.Ê For the price, it's inability to handle area rugs on hard floors was extremely disappointing."
05/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,One of the best investments ever,One of the best investments ever.Ê I have all tile floors.Ê The Roomba runs every day and always picks up cat hair that I have missed.Ê We live in the desert so there is always dust everywhere...but this cleans like a pro!Ê I haven't had any problems in the 2 months that I have had it.
10/07/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Not as good as I was hoping...,"On bare floors, this little baby works great. But it bogs down on some shag carpet that is not very thick at all. Disappointing."

We have a new construction home with a great deal of sand in the yard, as landscaping is coming along slowly and we have 2 pugs who shed an extreme amount of fur on an hourly basis while also bringing in sand since I haven't successfully trained them to wipe their feet upon entering the house.I charged the unit as soon as I received it and scheduled it to begin vacuuming early the next morning before I headed to work so that I could watch it and see if there were any problems that I needed to solve.Ê 'Rosie' has worked everyday for the past 2 weeks and I am extremely impressed.Ê The sand, fur and dust is collected each day while we work.Ê When I arrive home, I can go barefooted immediately.Ê It has only lost it's dock once, but that is acceptable.Ê She's a bit louder than I anticipated, but I rarely have her working while I'm home, so it's no big deal for me.Ê I can't say enough good things about 'Rosie'"
6/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Expensive, but marvelous fun and a REALLY good product!!!","OMG.... I love this, I love this, I love this! For me, I actually had a ""medical"" need for this. Severe back problems have made it difficult, if not impossible, for me to vacuum, and I really, really, really hate dirty floors! This does such a good job...I have an open plan house with hardwood floors and lots of throw rugs. I pick up light objects from the floor and get this going and it just cleans my house. Has no problems going from hard floor to throw rug and back to floor. There are some tight corners it can't reach, but a conventional vacuum cleaner would also be unable to get in to clean those spots, so I just take my swiffer or a broom and catch whatever in in those small areas.It's really fun to watch it when it detects a ""dirtier"" spot and goes into ""focus"" mode where it cleans that spot repeatedly until it has cleaned all the dirt.And the ""fun factor"" of this is absolutely priceless! Sometimes I throw dirt down on the floor just to watch it do its thing! I was hesitant to spend the money on it, but I'm really happy I did. The added features of this high-end model really come through with it doing a quality cleaning job.One note: I'm still trying to find the best location for the docking station, as it seems to have trouble finding it if it in not clearly in the line of vision, so sometimes I have to pick it up and put it right in front of the docking station. This is noted, somewhat, in the manual. Also, the manual is not the best-written, and provides some misleading or confusing information, but the iRobot folks know this and are working on improving the documentation.Nevertheless, I still love this device!!!"

7/24/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I love Lazlo!,"Okay, so I have only had Lazlo for a week, but he is great! Lightweight, portable, easy to clean, and very very smart! Be prepared to babysit initially. You need to see where there may be potential problems, as he will nose around a tight space to push his boundaries-- bad boy Lazlo! For instance, I had to block off a side table with books to keep him out of a too tight spot. Once you know how to best prep the room, you can then leave and let the little thug get on with it.A nice tip: I used the ubiquitous laundry pegs to peg up my dust ruffle, so he could nose around under the bed to his heart's delight. He really likes it under there! I love the fact that he knows not to dice with death at the stairs. He just huffily turns around and gets on with business--good boy Lazlo! I have to take some lessons in obedience training, as I cannot quite get the responses that I am looking for when using the remote control. Am I thick or is Lazlo just downright disobedient! I have not used the virtual wall/ lighthouse yet. I prefer, as another reviewer suggested, merely closing the doors!"
7/30/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,I've purchased this after reading all the reviews and wanted to have the best and newest products that will last for years,"OK, so, after having Refurbished Neato XV-21 and new one, I've decided it's time to get something that will actually move in the house and will not get stuck in the middle of nowhere and say error till the battery is drained.I have a puppy and he sheds and I wanted something to clean after him without babysitting it.I've purchased this after reading all the reviews and wanted to have the best and newest products that will last for years. After the first time I have to say that I was imppressed. the battery lasted for the whole apartment (big apartment with wooden floors and kicthen with tile, one bedroom.It finished and went back fully loaded to the dock. BUT the only problem is that I have 3 carpets in the living room and bedroom which are 40% of the atp's space and the nice vacuum cleaner doesn't go on them.My carpets are not that high and not dark colored so there where no reason for the robot no to climb and clean. When I called the customer service they told me that if I need robot for my carpets I better return this one and get no IROBOT. great customer support, at least they're honest.At the end I've decided to return this, buy the newer cheaper version 870 and surprice, it climbs on 2 of the 3 carpets and clean them with no problem. So the only different between the 880 and the 870 is the stupid remote control.So, anyway, if you need a good robot I would recommend to go with the Irobot roomba 870."

11/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,We want to love you but you are too sensitive!,"Ok so I want to love this robot so much because it does suck up dog hair, dirt and dust particles really well. However, it's very sensitive. We are constantly jiggering with it to deal with error messages, wiping down the sensors that are already scratched, bumping the edges so stuff comes out if it's stuck, etc. Latest error message we couldn't fix ourselves. The Left wheel is not rotating so the roomba keeps going in a circle - it looks like the treads are worn out already on the left-hand side so thus getting stuck:( We have reached out to customer care so hopefully they help us fix the issues so we didn't spend $100/mth on this vacuum. Can you please last for at least another 6 months???!!!!"
10/13/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Doesn't stop when it's full!,"OK returning this because1) It doesn't stop when it's full, and actually starts dumping debri everywhere once it's full.Ê I would come home and find piles of dirt all over the house.Ê Nice that it has a cannister full light, but this light is only useful if you keep checking on it.Ê Why doesn't the machine stop once the light comes on???Ê Talked to tech support and they confirmed there is no way for it to auto stop once it's full of dirt.Ê DEAL BREAKER for us.2) LOUD!Ê You pretty much have to run this when you're not home.Ê It's annoyingly loud3) Gets stuck under tables, beds, etc4) cleans randomly, doesn't seem to have any set pattern or to go over spots it hasn't covered"
07/09/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Roomba 1 Sweeping the floor 0,"Ok its expensive but after a month of use I will not live without a Roomba and Im thinking of the Scooba 450. The Roomba is programed to go everyday at 8AM, when I come home I empty the trash bin to find so much dust balls and cat fur, kinda cool. My floors are hardwood and tile with 3 throw rugs at the entrances and for the dog/cat in a corner. Now the daily maintenance of making sure there are no grandkids toys or clothes (ok my socks) thrown about and emptying the trash bin is really the only thing I need to do, other then that the floors are cleaned almost everyday and after a few months I think it pays for itself. Now is it perfect NO, does it miss certain areas like kitty cornered furniture or areas around the lighthouses or underneath the dinning room table with the chairs all tucked in, YES...Still 80-90% of the floor is cleaned EVERYDAY without human interaction. I highly recommend it"

Went online to Bed Bath and Beyond to get the 20% Off Coupon in exchange for my email address, then I ran down to the store and got a $140 discount off of the $700 price, so my 880 cost me $560, Yayyy!!! I disregarded the instructions to charge the battery for 24 hours before use and sicked it on the master bedroom to try it out as soon as I got it home. I set up the lighthouse to trap the vacuum in that one room, turned it on and watched it do its thing. I had to empty the tray 2 times and I ran it until I drained the battery all the way. So I am super impressed with the cleaning power of this little thing while being very grossed out at how much dirt/cat fur was trapped in my carpet, UGGHH! This vacuum has major sucking power and I plan to run it through the whole home until All of the dust and the fur from my 3 cats is history. I chose the 880 over the 870 because:A. I wanted the remote control.B. I wanted the 2 lighthouse/virtual wall units.C I could afford it by using the cool 20% off coupon.Now granted, I have only had this for a day, so for all I know it will spontaneously combust tomorrow, but for now, I am choosing to believe that I have found the solution to my cat fur problem and my desire to not vacuum all the time.

6/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,Max (NOT Enough) Headroom,"Not our 1st iRobot-- it's the best cleaning iRobot yet--EXCEPT that it's TALLER than the old version--and will NOT fit under MANY pieces of furniture or will jam itself into locations without the adequate headroom causing you to execute an annoying search and find mission to extricate it. We liked the fact that our old iRobot fit easily under our furniture to get all of the dust bunnies that our ""normal"" vacuum couldn't get.Ê iRobot customer service suggests placing coasters under your furniture to lift it up to the height where the iRobot will be able to get under the furniture to clean without getting stuck. I should NOT have to alter my entire environment so that the $700.00 iRobot will work effectively and I have never thought of ""furniture coasters"" as a wonderful design statement in my decor. VERY disappointing. We should have named our iRobot: ""Max NOT enough headroom"".Ê What were the engineers thinking?Ê Did they even test it in a ""normal"" household with normal furniture? Since my iRobot WON'T fit under my furniture, I could have just used my usual vacuum cleaner and SAVED $700.00.Ê If iRobot expects you to alter the height of your furniture to allow it to work, it should INCLUDE furniture coasters for that purpose in the $700.00 price.FYI- One plus about pets and the iRobot: Our nervous little dog is not as intimidated by the iRobot as she is with our usual vacuum cleaner.Ê And the iRobot does a great job dog picking up (short) dog hair---but the collection bin should be emptied every time the iRobot is run to be most effective."

01/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"easy operation, and easy to clean","My review:I bought my Roomba 880 in May 2014. My job has an odd schedule, which requires me to work very long hours in June, so I got the Roomba (who I've named Rex) so I wouldn't come home exhausted and have dirty floors on top of it. I keep cords off the floor or tuck them away because tangling can happen and I have ""Rex"" scheduled to clean when I'm at work and not there to rescue him. I am really impressed that he keeps my hardwood floors free of dust. They gleam.Ê I've run him every day since I got him and when I use my Hoover Floormate to wash the hard floors, the water it sucks up is so much cleaner than it used to be!Ê He does a great job on carpets too and brushes up the pile nicely on the cut loop style carpet.Ê I have long hair that always is so difficult to clean from the brushes of upright cleaners, but it's so easy with Rex!Ê I just pop out the easy-to-remove rubber rollers once a week and take out the hair that collects at the hollow spots where the connector pins, that hold the rollers in the machine, are located.Ê Rex is simpler to use and maintain than any other vacuum, even top-performing commercial kinds like Simplicity and Rainbow. My floors have never been cleaner AND he does the work for me! The commercial vacuums are the same price or more and they don't do the work for you,Ê so they will never keep your house as clean as the programmable Roomba. I always come home to clean floors.Ê It's a wonderful feeling. I've been so satisfied with my Roomba that I bought one as a Christmas present for my Mom (who is 59) and my Dad (who is 72) so they won't have to use their heavy Simplicity and wrench their backs. They love how their Roomba gets under the bed and they don't have to bend down.My Mom's review: cleans very well, easy operation, and easy to clean,Ê only problem is when cleaning the L.L. Bean waterhog mat, it is too nubby of a texture to pick up the dirt between the large nubs on the rug. But even uprights can have trouble vacuuming waterhogs."

7/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Love it!,My only reqret about this cleaner is that I waited so long before purchasing one. Well worth my money I have a golden that lives In the house. I was sweeping twice a day. This thing does the floor and I do something else. Love it!!!
04/03/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,If Only It Did Dusting Too,"My local Roomba distributor is hopeless, selling models long obsolete in the USA.Ê I imported this model to take care of polished solid-timber floors which I had nightmares about vacuuming every day for dust.Ê It has a switching power supply, so no problems with the local voltage.Ê Owned for a few weeks, and so far excellent.Ê My floors are clean and I don't have to think about damp-mopping more than once a fortnight.Ê I don't own any pets though.Ê My place is a bit of a maze, but it always finds its way home.Has a tendency to close doors and die behind them in small rooms, making it tricky to rescue.Power boards and masses of cables on the floor can be a problem.Ê You'll want to find a way to minimise these just like you would for a manual vacuum.These devices are not good for cleaning brand new carpet.Ê The pilling will fill the bin within seconds.Ê You'll need to manually vacuum these for months first.The bin is small, and could be easier to detach.Ê Capacity isn't really a problem in my case.These are all minor quibbles for what is a fantastic time-saving appliance."
5/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,The best Mother's Day gift ever!,"My husband game me the iRobot for Mother's Day, and this is the best present I've received in years.Ê He programmed my iRobot to vacuum in the early morning.Ê I wake up to clean floors!Ê It has no problem going from hard wood surface to carpet.Ê When it's done or when the charge is low, the vacuum returns to its docking station and recharges.Ê It is simple to empty the dust bin (a red light comes on to indicate when it's full).Ê I can press a button to spot clean an area.Ê In addition, my iRobot goes under the bed and gets the whole area vacuumed.Ê It has a little brush that extends out and rotates, so is able to clean up against walls and corners.Ê It slows down when approaching a wall or piece of furniture, and I am impressed with how it can clean around furniture legs and redirect itself.Ê This is a great product!Ê I am planning to purchase one for my parents."
5/27/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Total Roomba Girl!!!!,"My husband bought me the 780 for Christmas after much protest from me that I did not want one, I would not like it. Well I love it and it is my bff. I loved it so much we just purchased a 880 for the downstairs to replace this one and moved it upstairs so I guess you could say she (780) got a promotion. Then a good deal came up and I got the 450 Scooba.Seriously whoever you are if you clean your home you need at least one of these wonderful machines. I would fight anyone that would try to take mine from me. I have no idea how I lived without it for so long."
11/20/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Amazing cleaning robot,My house feels so much cleaner! Amazing how much dust this thing finds even with daily use and even when we thought everyhing was clean!
3/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Robots!!!,"My girlfriend is a neat freak, so I thought I'd lessen the load of vacuuming by getting the Roomba. This thing is amazing, and the fact that it self-docks, makes life much easier! We have a portable Dyson that we use to vacuum out the bin and the filter when it's full. The Dyson is a bit easier to empty than the Roomba, and it makes emptying the bin much cleaner and quicker. In tandem, the Roomba and the Dyson keep our hardwood floors and rugs nice and clean.Make sure your rugs are tacked down to the floor if they have a tendency to curl, or the Roomba will either bump them and treat them like an obstacle, or it will move them into large bunches all over the floor. The 880 moves from hardwood to rug without any problems otherwise.The scheduling feature is awesome, and we schedule the Roomba to clean everyday. It takes care of our dog's hair and never has a tangle issue. The maintenance is quick and easy, so as long as you into a pattern, this thing will make your floor cleaning life much easier.Note: Get used to the quirks of your furniture setup, so you can prevent the little bugger from getting stuck under chairs and couches. Once you make small adjustments, you'll notice cleaner floors all around.It's been about a week since we've gotten this robot, and although the company claims that the 880 is not a replacement for your upright vacuum, I can say confidently that we haven't used the upright at all. We'll see if that still rings true a month from now.This guy cleans about 1000 square feet, between multiple rooms every day. I like the fact that it still cleans as it heads to dock, and it still has plenty of battery power left over.If you have multiple rooms, you should consider investing in one, or two more lighthouses."

8/16/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I like to wear my shoes indoors,"My dog likes to shed. I like to wear my shoes indoors. My wife likes to drop stuff. Overall, we all create quite a bit of mess. This Roomba catches a lot of the trash we leave behind. It easily navigates the carpeted and hard-wood areas of the house and pulls up much of the debris that plagued us in our previous living areas. Keeping the house clean has become significantly easier since I bought this little guy, now I have much less demand to vacuum the house to clean up after the dog and myself."
08/01/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Works flawlessly,"My dad has bad cat allergies, but now lives in a house with two cats. (Long story) He hasn't had a problem since we bought this. We just turn it on every night, (on wood floor downstairs) and in the morning it always has a full storage bin of cat hair. This amazed me, since in the day I don't notice a single hair. We never need to vacuum downstairs anymore, and my dad never has allergy problems anymore. It always returns to its charging station by morning, except 3 or 4 times in the entire year we've owned it. Those three or four times were completly our fault, and we found a half eaten charging cord next to the vacuum the following day. A must have for any household with pets!"

My cats are entertained by it as well. It seems to actually clean some surfaces more thoroughly than my Dyson upright (with the correct attachments).Plus, litter box scatter is no longer a problem. Roomba roams the basement floor..."
11/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,"Dear iRobot, PLEASE add a child lock...","My 1.5yr old changed the scheduled cleaning time for the third time. Last night the roomba woke everyone up at 2am when it started diligently cleaning the downstairs. I'm really surprised the roomba doesn't have a child lock. Even my washer and dryer have child locks. If you are a parent and your children are obsessed with ""bot bot"", I'm sure you would appreciate this. Otherwise, it works fairly well. It usually misses a couple spots, but still better than cleaning the floors ourselves."
3/31/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Want a 2nd one for upstairs,Much quieter than earlier models. Does not get hung up easily. Vacuum your carpet with your full size vacuum and then run the 880 over the same area and see the additional dirt it picks up.
12/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Best one yet.,Much improvement of the three we already own. I wanted one that programs so I didn't ned to screw if it. just check the bin every now and then.

06/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Tears of Joy.,"Mine was purchased off ebay at a much better price. My dog sheds a lot and I recently acquired a kitten and between the two, I used to wake up and start my morning by swiffer-ing the hardwood floor and scooping cat litter. I programmed this roomba to work at 5AM daily and now I wake up to CLEAN floor. Honestly I can't get over how it does much better job than I. After all, roomba does clean for about an hour, its little brush thing gets the corners real well. Considering I was considering getting cleaning service more frequently, this is worth every penny of it.Now on the new kitten and Roomba. Kitten, [James] has completed day 3 of training riding sessions. He's not afraid of it, but he hasn't gotten the hang of staying on it. He does follow it around, I see a lot of potential with this young one. I figured get him started early.This morning, I caught myself talking to it softly while sipping coffee. Roomba and Litter Robot, I feel they have added years to my life."

09/04/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Wish I had bought it sooner!!!,"Meet Rosey, named for the Jetson's housekeeping robot.Ê She is wonderful!Ê I have an Alaskan Malamute with hardwood floors and large area rugs.Ê Rosey vacuums every morning and my floors are cleaner than ever.Ê My great room is 23' x 44' and I divide it with the 'lighthouse' into two areas for maximum efficient coverage.Ê Some days I put the dining room chairs up on the table and some days not.Ê Rosey knows to vacuum thoroughly either way.Ê Some days I have her cross another lighthouse into the entry and the bedroom hallways and some days I keep it as a 'wall' and not do the entry.Ê She just knows what I want and does it.Ê Because I have the dog and carpets I have to empty the dust bin at least once during her cleaning session.Ê And because I have a long furred Malamute, sometimes Rosey leaves little clumps of fur here and there for me to pick up after she is done.Ê This is much easier to pick up than lots of flying dust bunnies on a daily basis.Ê I bought the 880 model because it did not have brushes that would tangle with fur.Ê Quite seriously I am amazed and disturbed at how much dirt is picked up on a daily basis.Ê We are empty nesters with two or three days a week visits from my son's family of three (1yr old).Ê The dirt is a sorry example of how much comes in despite our best efforts.Ê My daughter-in-law comments on how clean the floors always look now.Ê I love Rosey!!!"
12/12/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,"Weak performance, poor durability. I would not purchase again.","Many other reviewers suggest waiting several weeks to write a review after using the product and I agree with this suggestion. After operating the machine in various areas of my 3,000 ft2 home over a four month period I have made the following observations (""+"" = Positive & ""-"" =Ê Negative):- The motor that drives the Debris Extractors became weak over time and finally failed... I take some responsibility for this because I have an area rug (~ 8' X 10') that is ""shag"" and this relatively small rug in my home may have contributed to the demise of the motor - I could hear the 880 laboring as it worked on the rug+ Unlike others, by experience with customer service was excellent! I explained my situation, including the info above, to the customer service rep on the phone, she asked several questions to confirm the situation, then after 2 minutes on hold (I assume to get authorization from a superior) she offered to replace the cleaning head module free of charge under warranty and indicated it would arrive in ~ 2 weeks- I have a cat and over time the 880 became less efficient at picking up the cat fur - it would just roll the fur up into little rolls on the carpet and move them around the floor. I thought this was an indication that the filter needed to be replaced, but after installing a new filter pickup was no better+ When the extractors were working the 880 was very efficient picking up small amounts of litter the cat tracks out of the litter box onto the hardwood floor- I have another area rug with a 5"" black boarder and as described by many others the cliff sensors are unable to differentiate between the dark boarder and a cliff so the 880 is ineffective around this rug+ The virtual walls are very helpful for containing the 880 in specific areas so cleaning can be done one section at a time - the 880 is unable to manage more than a couple of rooms in one cleaning session due to the complex geometry of multiple rooms so it has to be broken down into segments to be effective, not to mention the battery only lasts ~1.5 - 2 hrs- This machine does not bring me $700 worth of value based on its poor durability, inability to manage area rugs, & poor fur pick-up on carpet. This amount of money pays for 3 months of my home cleaning service (every other week) and this service does A LOT more than vacuuming of my floorsIn conclusion, the concept is great and I think this is a very good application for a ""robot"", but based on my experience I would not purchase the Roomba 880 again. If it were not for the good help I received from Customer Service I would have to give this $700 machine that lasted only 4 months a single star... I can't afford that kind of expense!"

7/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great vacuum!,"Love love love this guy! I have been wanting a Roomba for a couple years now. I finally decided to splurge and get one because we just had our 2nd baby and I was not in the mood to vacuum! All I had to do was charge it over night before I first used it and it was good to go! So easy to use! The first clean took quite a while. I was under the impression that you could just stick it on the floor and let it clean that whole level as long as doors were open. I think it was starting to do that, but It died after about an hour and 45 mins of cleaning. I have since learned to use the virtual walls that came with it and let it clean one room at a time. It's a lot more efficient that way.As for the actual performance - it is awesome! In preparation for the Roomba, I had vacuumed AND shampooed my carpets the day before I knew it would be here. So I would say it was very clean carpet to start with, at least I thought so. After the Roomba died on that first run, and I decided to empty the bin, I was completely baffled by the amount of dirt it picked up!!! The bin was packed FULL. I don't even know how that was possible but my vacuum/shampooer must just not be cutting it.When it is finished cleaning the room, there will be a little victory song. I wasn't aware of this since it died on its first run due to my lack of virtual walls. I had it cleaning my sons room and thought it was taking forever and I wasn't sure if it stopped or just went until it died. I finally heard the song after about 45 minutes. So don't worry! Some rooms take forever to clean, but you don't have to manually stop it.As for where it stops, prepare to use your remote/dock sometimes. Somehow this little guy decided that it really loves being under beds. It was okay when it did its little victory dance underneath my daughters twin bed because I could actually reach it.Ê However, as I walked into our master bedroom and heard the victory song under our bed, I groaned. Of course it stopped RIGHT in the center so it was impossible to reach. I had to grab the dock from the kitchen, bring it into view of the Roomba, then use the remote to get it to dock. That was a pain in the butt.The noise level is tolerable. When it's in the same room as you, I would compare it to it sounding like there's a real vacuum in a different room. If that makes sense. It didn't bother me at first but considering how long it takes to clean some rooms, it gets a little old. Which is a little annoying when you work from home and you can't schedule it to clean when you're gone.I'll post updates in a few months!UDATE (8/3/16) - I still LOVE my Roomba! I can't tell you how awesome it feels to come home from a busy day and see the room freshly vacuumed!Ê Anyway, I am writing this update because I had an issue earlier.Ê I had put our Roomba downstairs to clean and noticed that it was making a weird clicking noise. There was nothing visible so I knew it had to be under the wheels somewhere. I didn't have my manual on hand but decided I could maybe figure out how to pop everything off and clean it on my own. It took 2 seconds! I flipped Roomba over and there were obvious tabs to push to pop the wheels out. Somehow a chapstick cap had gotten sucked up!Ê They really make this thing user friendly.

That and the fact that we have 4 kids, 2 labs and tons of hardwood floors. The kids love to play with the Roomba which is fine with me. The more action it gets, the cleaner the floors :-) It's not something you want to turn on when you're home but while you're away, it's beast. We have an Aerus Electrolux canister vacuum that I use when I'm cleaning the house and I thought that thing was the best but now I'm beginning to wonder. When we empty the Roomba's dirt compartment I literally can't. I mean. It's amazing. Where does all that stuff come from?! Yuck! But very happy that it's getting off the floor and into the trash. I think I'm on my way to bare feet inside soon!"

12/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,It doesn't like the rug in our living room,"Living with Roomba - Day 1Roomba comes with two of these little doohickies that you can use to keep it out of rooms. I put one by the bathroom door as it got into all kinds of trouble in there yesterday: it ruffled up two of the rugs and then got itself trapped under the medicine cabinet after it moved the trash can. Yes, it's a boisterous little bugger, strong enough to move dining chairs, and I just watched it as it figured out how to open the pocket door to the closet!Gabby, our labrador, is completely indifferent to it, but does keep an eye on it whenever it heads her way. If she stays on the rug she's mostly safe.It does a very thorough job of cleaning and it's fascinating to watch. It doesn't like the rug in our living room, however, it seems to be on the the threshold of what it can handle. Mostly it hits the edge like it's a wall and changes direction. Also it spends an awful lot of time under the bed, what's it doing under there?Now if they can just make something that will do the laundry, clean the windows, dust, load and unload the dishwasher..."

4/30/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,"Does a decent job but can't justify the price, Still has same flaws from original 2002 release","Let me start out by saying I'm a big fan of Irobot, I even own some stock in them.Ê I bought the original Roomba when it first came out in 2002.Ê I had also owned one of the Discovery Models (4XX series) , I also owned a 5XX model as well as a 6XX model.Ê Obviously they never were good enough to be a replacement for my regular vacuums but they were great for weekly maintenance when I didn't want to vacuum.Ê Also they were a great topic of conversation (back in the early days before they were so wide spread).Ê Unfortunately they never seemed to last and while Irobot had good customer service, after the year warranty you were pretty paying expensive repair bills.Ê The last few models I owned I purchased from BBB or Costco due to their amazing return policies.Now fast forward a bit, in 2013 I started seeing reviews for the Neato vacuums., while I didn't know much about the company I was impressed that they map the room rather then just bumping around like the Roomba.Ê I ended up purchasing a Neato XV-21 and sold my 6XX series Roomba.Over the course of the last 2 years I actually came to really like the Neato, the suction was pretty much on par with the Roomba and it seemed to hit every spot on the carpet.Ê I also liked how you could add new features by doing a firmware upgrade yourself.Now fast forward to a few weeks ago.Ê The batteries were barely holding a charge on the Neato,Ê it was about time to replace some of the rollerbars and filters etc.Ê I decided I would look into upgrading to one of the newest generations of robotic vacuums.It came down to the Neato Botvac 85,Ê The Roomba 790 or the Roomba 880.I ended up going with the Roomba 880, because I was intrigued by their claim of maintenance free and the new non-tangle brushes.Ê (I have a Shiba Inu and there is dog hair everywhere).Ê Also there was a Mothers Day sale going on so the price was lower, as well as I had 2 nice credits where I had purchased it, so in the end I only paid about $360 for it.Ê There is no way I would pay over $400 for this product, especially with the puny warranty they come with.Now that I'm done rambling on with the back story let me get to the actual product review.Ê I listed a few pros and cons at the bottom, but I just want to talk about a few in more detail.* First of all, the Roomba 880 looks very sleek and cool looking, unfortunately when it comes to a vacuum this isn't always great.Ê In just 1 week there are scratch marks all over the glossy top.* Iadapt technology?Ê - This is my biggest beef,Ê Irobot has had 13 years since the original roomba was released and they still haven't added mapping technology to this thing?Ê As soon as I used this new model for the first time I immediately missed how the Neato rarely bumped into anything.Ê The 880 bumps into everything, I know they list it as a soft touch bumper, but if its so soft why are there already scratch marks on the bumper.* Another big issue for me, in 13 years they haven't fixed the issue with the Roomba going over black patterns or dark rugs?Ê Why aren't the cliff sensors set to detect depth rather then color?*Ê The cleaning and vacuum system is much improved from previous models, but I'm wondering by loosing the bristles on the brushes is it really getting deep down into the carpet and rug fibers as previous models.Ê There is a reason every vacuum manufacture uses bristles for their vacs (they work)Ê Maybe I can find a friend with a 7XX series and run a comparison test.Ê Does the stronger suction out-way the bristles doing a deep clean.Pros:Slick LookingEasy to setAmazing job picking up dirt, dust and hairvirtually maintenance freebin full alert noticelighthouse featurequietCons:scratches easilystill a dumb robot and bumps into anythingemptying the filter/bin is pretty messy.does not work on black carpet or carpet with black patternscarrying handle seems flimsy.So in conclusion, this is just a decent robotic vacuum.Ê In my opinion it is not worth the $600+ price tag.Ê If someone would take the Neato 85 and the Roomba 880 and merge them together you would have the ultimate robotic vacuum.Ê I guess will see what happens with the Dyson Robotic vacuum that will be coming out soon."
2/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Works but with frustrations.,"Let me begin by giving some background. This Roomba 880 is my first experience with a robotic vacuum. I cannot compare it to any other model either from iRobot or any other company. I have a fairly large house and I decided to try this device out on the first floor and limit it to three rooms, to keep down the animal hair from two Labrador Retrievers. I bought an additional virtual wall / lighthouse for a total of three. One is used as a wall and the other two as lighthouses. The idea was to have the Roomba clean three contiguous rooms; the home station is in the center room and the other two rooms are on opposite sides and marked by the lighthouses. The house has a moderately open floor plan but there is furniture in the center of the rooms, in addition to against the walls. Also, although I gave this review three stars, I would have preferred three and a half, if that were possible.I am reminded of the opening of Dickens A Tale of Two Cities: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. With respect to the Roomba I would say it is a remarkable machine, it is a very flawed machine. The Roomba works, but at least in my configuration, there are significant frustrations. First, the lighthouses dont work quite as they should. As they are described in the configuration I have, the Roomba should spend approximately one-third of its time in the first room, go to a lighthouse and spend about a third in that room, and then move on to the last lighthouse-marked room and finish there before returning to the home base. This rarely happens; it may have done this once. It usually runs around the first room, goes into one of the other two and then docks. My expectations for the lighthouses may be unrealistic, but this is the impression given by the advertising. The virtual wall works as advertised.A bigger frustration is that it seems like much of my furniture was specifically designed to entrap a Roomba. Most of the bedroom pieces and a credenza in the family room all trap or wedge the Roomba under the front ledge of the furniture. If the furniture was half an inch higher or lower Im sure it wouldnt happen, but the furniture is what it is. The Roomba gets trapped somewhere every time, often more than once during a run. Not exactly set-it-and-forget-it.Bottom line: with some fussing and un-wedging, it still picks up quite a bit of dog hair that would still be on the floor if I didnt use it."
9/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,Very upset with iRobot,"Less than 3 months later that I bought my iRobot Roomba 880, its sensors stop working and doesn't recognize its dock, virtual wall and remote control!

10/06/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Excellent, but here is what it does not do well:","Just to give this some context, at this point I have quite a bit of experience with robotic vacuums.Ê More than two years ago I purchased a Neato Botvac 85 with which I was very happy.Ê I was so satisfied with it that I purchased a second one so that I would not have to move it back and forth between the two floors of my house.The Neato started having technical problems a couple months ago.Ê That, combined with some annoyances I had experienced and a recent ""leading consumer magazine"" review convinced me to try the Roomba 880.Let's get this out of the way: The Roomba 880 does an excellent job of cleaning a room.Ê It probably does a somewhat better job of cleaning your room than the Neato Botvac 85, particularly on carpeting, but you would not be dissatisfied with either one.Ê One thing that I really like about it is that the cleaning brush is designed in such a way that it does not get tangled with the fringe on the edge of your carpet (the Neato does) and it does not get all covered with long hair and strings that later need to be cut away.Ê It also is better than the Neato at hopping over high thresholds between rooms.Ê But it is not perfect.Ê Here are some of the things that I wish it did better than it does:- It runs into things much harder than the Neato Botvac.Ê As I write this review the Roomba 880 stopped by to clean the room I am in, and when it bumped into my chair, I definitely felt a bit of a jolt.Ê The Neato was much more gentle.Ê Why does this matter?Ê Well, on several occasions the Roomba has trapped itself inside of various rooms when it ran into their open doors and forced them closed.Ê I have come home a couple hours later to find my tiny mud room exceptionally clean after 90 minutes of the Roomba trying to find its way out unsuccessfully because of the now closed door.Ê It has also knocked over a number of things left on the floor, such as fireplace tools, that were immune to the bumps of the Neato.- The dust / debris compartment is too small and is somewhat difficult to clean.Ê Apparently this model Roomba has a dust compartment that is larger than past models, but that is hard to imagine.Ê The compartment is about half the capacity of the Neato Botvac.Ê Also, it is harder to remove from the vacuum and harder to clean both the dust compartment and the filter.- The charging / docking station is annoying.Ê At first I thought it was pretty cool:Ê Very small and light, what's not to like?Ê First of all, unlike the Neato, there is no place to store the excess power cord, so if your docking station is one foot away from the plug, you have several feet of cord laying on the floor preventing the Roomba from effectively cleaning that area.Ê Worse than that, often when the Roomba runs over the excess cord it ends up moving the charging station.Ê More than once I have come home to find the Roomba with a dead battery six inches from the docking station because it had run over the power cord and, in doing so, turned the docking station around 180 degrees so that it was now acing the wall and unreachable to the Roomba.- It does not deal with slanted first steps well.Ê I live in an old house and the threshold just before my basement stairway is tilted slightly downward toward the stair.Ê The Roomba get stuck there every time.- Its navigation is not as sophisticated as it could be.Ê For comparison, when it came to navigating a room or a house, the Neato Botvac was a total genius.Ê It regularly could find its way back to the docking station from three rooms and multiple doorways away without any problems.Ê This was without any assistance in the form of beacons or anything.Ê The Roomba 880 often gets confused and needs assistance.- It is pretty slowÊ The Botvac 85 could clean a large room in about 20 minutes.Ê I am pretty picky about cleanliness, and I was quite happy with its result.Ê I think the Roomba 880 does a bit better job (maybe 10% better???) but it take about an hour to do the same room.Ê If you are not home when it runs, who cares?Ê But if you are looking for a cleaning before you have company, you better plan ahead.So, this all sounds negative, but please understand that I gave the Roomba 880 FIVE stars.Ê I still am glad I bought it.Ê If I was offered the Neato Botvac 85 or the Roomba 880 for free, but I could only have one?Ê Tough call.Ê I would go with the Roomba 880, but it would be with some uncertainty.Ê If they would just make a few changes (more gentle on impact, larger, easier to clean dust bin, more sophisticated navigation) it would be almost perfect."
4/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,MyRobot OK. So Far So Good.,"Just received our robot day before yesterday, and have only run it three times so far. The first time it went one hour ten minutes, and the light came on the dust bin was full, so after it docked itself I cleaned it per the instruction manual. The next morning it took off running again, and ran one hour fifteen minutes. This time the dust bin didn't fill up completely so the light indicator did not come on. I cleaned it anyway as the instructions indicate I should. This afternoon I set it to go for 4:00 PM, and it did. At 4:00 PM the R2 D2 sounds could be heard, and it was off, and running again. This time it picked up even less, but it is keeping the place nice, and clean. We bought the device to keep an 800 sq. ft. atrium room clean. The floor is tile throughout, and by keeping the dog, and the cats out of the room the robot can get it cleaner everyday. Later we will be having the animals into the room more, but right now they stay out. We are in the process of remodeling the entire house so the little robot will be getting a workout in the future, and we'll come back to comment later. I think from what I've seen of this little guy so far that it's going to be a good relationship. I can't see any negatives with it at this point."
05/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Impressed so far,"Just received it today, easy set up, after initial charge I turned it on, it is not quite silent and it takes time for it to find every corner of the room!yet after 30 minutes it almost covered every inch of my living room that I mop(hard floor) 2-3 times a week and filled its bin..surprisingly there was lots of dust and debris collected. I am impressed!comes with two lighthouses!Ê im trying to figure out how to place them so I could navigate the cleaner toward the bed room and other corridor !also has a remote that you can steer the robot in case!so far good :)"
6/20/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Just get it! You won't regret it!,Just get the Roomba! I know you are probably scouring reviews deciding if its really worth the $700 well let me tell you it is! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE mine. Love it. It picks up so much stuff! I'm always amazed how much it picks up even when I run it everyday. I have 2 dogs who shed a lot and it picks the hair up no problem. It even picked up a quarter yesterday and I was impressed at that. It does take a little bit of maintenance. I have very long hair and it gets wound up on the edges of the rollers (hard to explain without you knowing what it looks like) But it takes less than 2 minutes to clean it all out really good.I've had mine for over a month and run it everyday I've used the scheduling which works great but I just put it in the room I want it to clean and press the button. Seriously this is a life changer just get it.
05/11/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Totally awesome and worth every penny.,Just awesome. My wife asked for this for over a year and a half but I just thought it was a gimmick.

My only regret my wife had to vacuum for that last year and a half while she was asking for it.Ê When you see everything it picks up every single day and then it makes it around your whole entire house and then it docs itself back on the charger you're going to be giggling like we were.

On those days I pick up the chairs and anything else in the way ( bed and bath trash cans, bath room scale, bed room and kitchen chairs, wedge the couch side tables so it can't get behind the couch and get stuck, and like the sweeper brush gets under the counter edges in the kitchen, Ha) and if you run it when you get home to clean the areas it missed its under foot and noisy! I hate this machine, I gave it 8 months because of my dear sweet wife but enough is enough!!! I'll vacuum on the weekend and do it cheerfully!!!! Don't waste your money, don't move everything for this pig and keep your stress factor low!!!!"
09/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I love it,Ive had my Roomba for a couple months now.Ê I absolutely love this vacuum.Ê I have white tile and three rat terriers that shed bad.Ê The dogs along with a sandy area I live makes my floors get dirty every day.Ê The Roomba has solved my issues.Ê The amount of dust in my home has reduced drastically from keeping my floor cleaned every evening.The goodCleans my entire home easily 1350sqft is allCut down the dustfun to watcheasy to cleancan clean under my big bedThe Bad :(will get stuck in places at times like the antique baby chair it can somehow get over the rocker and high center.Like to be wherever I am at.Ê Its like the little sucker can sense me and follow me around my house like a little puppy dog.Ê It's annoying.Ê If im in the kithcen cooking it will be in there under my feet.Ê If I am in the living room it will spends its entire battery in there bumping my recliner.Ê I tell it to leave me alone and it will go away for a few minutes and come right back.Ê just like the annoying neighbor kid that just wont go away.It will eat cables.Ê Sucks them up and trys to drag your charger across the house.Ê Ive found it a few times like this.Ê Seems like its trying to hang itself so it can have a day off.Will get lager objects stuck under the rollers and drag them around the house making awful noises until you can stop it.can get caught under the cabinet edges.Looks like I have more bad than good but I wouldn't want to be without it.Ê My poor shark vacuum only gets used to clean the roomba these days.Ê I love this vacuum
6/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Good Little Roomba! Good Boy!Ê Give Daddy that nasty ole dust ball.Ê Good Boy!Ê Yes, you are!","Ive had my Roomba 880 for about a month now and wanted to report my experience with it because its a pricey purchase.Ê The Roomba 880 lists for 700.00 and I purchased mine at Bed, Bath, and Beyond with a 20% off coupon; final purchase price was $560.00 plus tax.Ê Brought the Roomba home and let it charge for a full day.Ê Next day I started it up and half way through its cleaning cycle I could not resist, I had to stop it and check the dust bin; the dust bin was already full and dirt was backing up into the rollers.Ê This was my operation pattern for the first two or three days then, half way through the week it was time to not hover over it any longer and to let it do its thing while I was at work.Ê For the next three to five days it got stuck in different places and I Roomba proofed those areas by either putting up one virtual wall and one virtual lighthouse or slightly modifying my 1800 Sq foot basement layout that I wanted it to clean.Ê Most of the time now, it finds its way back to the charging station and the dust bin is 75% full.Ê Verdict: For a guy who works all day, comes home, may work in the yard until the sun goes down, then comes in, makes dinner and then finally wants to sit down and take a break, this is a great labor saving device.Ê The carpets are now much cleaner than I used to keep them with my Dyson and its just one less thing that I have to do.Ê I will be buying another for the main floor."
06/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,I named my Roomba Colin,"Ive had Colin for a few weeks and despite how comically stupid he can be, he does a pretty good job. My floors are noticeably cleaner and I love to come home and see all the trails Colin leaves behind in the carpet after vacuuming.However, Colin does have some bad habits. He likes to go into rooms and trap himself by pushing the door closed. He will then clean the heck out of the room until his battery dies so hard he forgets what day it is, (Seriously. When this happens I have to reset the date and time).Colin also has occasional docking problems. His dock is so light weight that sometimes when he is undocking, Colin will shift it so that he cant redock. He then proceeds to happily vacuum the floors until he once again forgets what day it is.Overall, Im happy with Colins performance. I was able to fix his bad habits by buying doorstops for all my doors and taping his dock to the floor. Ill have to see if these self induced marathon vacuuming sessions have an adverse effect on the battery life.Dont Panic."

4/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Good for daily upkeep; suction power not strong enough to be primary vacuuum,"It's good, not great.Ê I bought this very expensive thing more for convenience rather than its suction power.Ê The instructions aren't very thorough, but I was able to get the information I needed by searching online.Ê It does a good enough job, but it doesn't do a very thorough job.Ê I have old parquet hardwood floors and some of the wood has sort of splintered away, creating larger than desired gaps between the parquet tiles.Ê The Roomba's suction power isn't strong enough to get the dust that accumulates between the panels.Ê Therefore, I still need to use my hand vacuum to get those spots when doing a more thorough clean.Ê This is why I can't recommend it as the primary vacuum in the house.Ê Better to invest in a Miele if you can only afford one good machine.Ê That being said, the Roomba is good for every day maintenance of clean-enough floors.Ê As my apartment accumulates dust bunnies all too frequently, and my back isn't up to the constant vacuuming, this was worth getting for general upkeep.Ê The little revolving sweeper is good at getting at the dust along the wall edges.Ê Also, it's kind of cool that when it's done, it finds the base and docks itself."
05/03/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Irobot rating and comment,"It's good, it beats me vacuuming.Ê I turn it on almost everyday.Ê I am amazed on how much dirt it picks up.Ê The only thing I fine is that it doesn't really detect dirt.Ê But since I vacuum everyday if it does not pick it up today it will pick it up tomorrow."
11/29/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,"Good product, save a lot of time for me.","It's good, I don't need to clean my appartment myself after I bought it, the only issues it's a little stupid and sometimes start cleanning in the middle of the night or can lost his way in one of the rooms. But in general good product, saving a lot of time for me."
4/19/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Goes all over the place while cleaning, but she does it well!","It's funny to watch Rosie (My Romba 880 named after the Jetson's cleaning bot) go all over the floor in what appears to be an erratic fashion, but in the end, the floor is spotless!Ê At first I was wondering how she could possibly be tracking where she cleaned at, but I was pleasantly surprised in the end.The Roomba 880 comes with two lighthouse/virtual walls, a remote control, an extra HEPA filter, manuals (Including troubleshooting data) and other papers, batteries for all the accessories and the Roomba, and the docking station.Ê The remote works on two AA batteries and each of the lighthouse/virtual wall units work on two C size batteries.Ê The Roomba works on a proprietary rechargeable battery that should last quite a while.Ê Roomba says, ""iRobot XLife Battery: XLife Battery delivers twice as many cleaning cycles as previous Roomba batteries, doubling the time before you may need to replace your Roomba battery.Ê Roomba runtime remains the same between recharges. Battery lifetime varies with home environment and usage. Use Roomba as directed for longest battery life.""If you activate your warranty on the iRobot website, you get a free gift. (I haven't gotten mine in the mail just yet, so I don't know what it is and as they don't tell you what it is, I don't think they want ou to know until you get it.Ê It's a gift!)Ê Some robots come with free coupons when you register them and the Roomba 880 might start being one of those robots at some point.Ê In short, register your bot and see what comes of it.Ê It activates your warranty as well.Now for the part of pros and cons.Ê (There are too many pros, so I'm just highlighting a few of the more important ones to me.)PROS:1.) You can schedule the Roomba to clean house once a day every day of the week or less.2.) The lighthouses can be configured as virtual walls.Ê When in virtual wall mode, they block the bot just as much as any other wall would.Ê When in lighthouse mode, they block the bot until it finishes cleaning the room it's in in order to clean most effectively.Ê Got a hallway?Ê Put up a lighthouse!Ê No door?Ê Lighthouse it!Ê They also have a 3 state switch that you can specify the distance you want the IR beam's thin conical shape to cover.Ê The lighthouses turn on when the Roomba is on and off when the Roomba is off.Ê This saves the lighthouse batteries.3.) It fits under objects that regular vacuums cannot.Ê (Ex. The refrigerator door, kitchen table chairs, etc.)4.) It never gets tangled in even the smallest of the wires near my desk and has even gone over top of them to clean that space!5.) The remote allows you to tell the bot to clean, spot clean a 3' area, and dock.Ê You can also control the bot to move forward, turn left, and turn right, but it doesn't allow you to tell it to move backwards for some odd reason which could be helpful in some situations.6.) If you're a programmer or roboticist, you have a 7 pin TTY serial port under the flap on top of the unit.Ê I've only ever played with 4 pin TTY, so I'll have to see what the other 3 pins are for.Ê You can probably talk to it with PuTTY and MAYBE use the iRobot Create stuff.Ê The manual says you can reprogram the Robot with that port as well, so if you're looking for a programmable bot that's possibly more up to date physically than the Create (Create is a stripped down version of the old Roomba 400) and you don't mind paying the $700 price tag for it, you could use this Roomba 880 as a bot to experiment with.CONS:1.) It crashes into stuff fairly hard.Ê It hasn't broken anything yet and it does have a bumper to cushion the blow, but it makes me a bit nervous.Ê I'm a neat freak, so having stuff bumped into a lot makes me wonder if things will get busted.Ê It does seem to slow down before the crash, though, so there is some kind of mechanism telling it that it's about to collide.2.) It gets tangled in the bed skirt sometimes as the bed skirt drapes quite heavily to the floor.Ê It also gets tangled sometimes on floppy rugs.Ê (The kind of rugs that don't have a rubber backing)3.) It doesn't seem to clean rugs all that well.Ê (Floppy or not - I have both.)4.) It makes a whining sound everywhere it goes.Ê It's not the zoom sound that the upright vacuum cleaners make and isn't terribly loud, but it just makes a whining sound.Ê You can learn to tune it out as it's monotonous.Ê Personally I don't mind it right now."
10/05/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,It's fantastic!,"It's fantastic! Keeps on top of the hair my two German Shepherds drop on a daily basis. The only very small gripe I've got is it's a bit noisy, but easy enough to shut the door and leave it to get on with its task. Just love it!!!"
05/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,So far so fine,It's been great for a month. I hope it lasts many years.
12/26/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I still love the thing and can't do without it,"It's been about a half a year. I think that's long enough for me to have an opinion on it. I know a lot of reviews mention early on they can't imagine living without it, then a few months later they wind up forgetting it. I want to testify against these reviews. After 6 months, I still love the thing and can't do without it.I'm not a big cleaner. Most people mention they're clean freaks and get a roomba for that reason. In my case I didn't care much about sweeping up the place but I knew if I didn't want my computer overheating every few months I'd have to tackle this dust situation. My roommate was also moving out and I knew the problem was only going to get worse without them sweeping up. Air purifiers only marginally helped to combat the dust. Using this thing, though, has made a noticeable difference, and it does so with minimal effort. After the usual dust purge that accompanies purchasing one, I maybe get a full dust bin maybe once a week. The computer has yet to develop any further issues."
07/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Saves time and effort, clean up neatly","It's been 8 to 9 months we are using roomba, we have a lab with us who sheds throughout the year, Labradors are known for heavy shedding , roomba in one word saved me,Ê my efforts, time , no we I just turn it on and do my own stuff , I don't need to think about it, it cleans very neatly, very easy to handle and operate, saves time , amazingly helpful"

03/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,"Great cleaning result, but easily get stuck on chairs or hung on stairway","It works pretty well. Our home got a lot cleaner with its daily cleaning schedule. However, it gets stuck a lot and the cleaning has to stop. It also hangs on the edge of stairways and stops working quite often, where it's supposed to stop. I'm doubting if it Is a defective unit with a foggy sensor."

10/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,It works fine but I am not very happy on its scheduling ...,"It works fineÊ but I am not very happy on its scheduling features. Although it claims that you set the timing and don't have to worry about it, but the reality is that it regularly gets lost in the house and doesn't come back to docking on its own. So, we have to bring it back once a while ourselves for charging.Also, still couldn't figure out how to maneuver it using the remote - it doesn't respond promptly to remote buttons.Overall it's good but for the price I feel it is still less of value for money.Important, it is far from your total vacuum cleaning solution- It is good as a second cleaner, it helps to clean to some extend but it can't replace the traditional cleaner - that means you will still need another, traditional vacuum for your complete cleaning."
11/26/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Need smaller house in order for this to be effective.,"It works fairly good, but has a real hard time getting everywhere in the house. Maybe it would work better in a small house, or I would have to spend several thousand more to have one in every room."
07/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,This product will keep the dog / cat hair off the floors,"It works better then I expected. I bought it because of dog hair. I run it once a day over about 1500 sq ft of tile and wood floors and it does a good job picking up the dog hair. The ""Virtual Wall Lighthouse"" is a great feature as well. My only complaint, I think it's a bit ""pricey"".."
6/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Color me surprised.Ê It works.,"It works as advertised.Ê I was actually suprised.Ê I thought it was a gimmick, but it gets up all sorts of stuff and is so easy to use my 9 year old set it up.Ê We named it ""Mrs. Jones,"" my 4th grade teacher, because Mrs. Jones sucked.Ê In fact it works so well, we bought two more!"
1/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,It was very nice until it's broken,It was very nice until it's broken. The side spinner stopped working after 3 months of purchase. I followed the video and cleaned the spinner but it still does not work. And the anti-tangle light is always on. I think it is related to the anti-tangle sensor.Considering this thing is ridiculously expensive. I would expect it should work smoothly without any issue. But just in 3 months this happens. Now I have to call them and figure out what to do and waste my time on this. Definitely not worth the price!Update: I contacted them and they sent me a replacement module for the side spinner. Now everything works as before. Pumped up the rating to 4 stars.
12/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,It is really disappointing!!!,"It was very good for the first two weeks. However,Ê It just turns around but does not pick up anything now! Definetely, you won`t get what you pay for."

I bargained with my husband to try this first since I am pretty private. I don't regret it for a second. Bonus feature: babysitting my 18 month old when I need to focus on something else for 5 min!!!
04/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Great for hide-and-go seek,"It vacuums pretty well and floor coverage and obstacle avoidance is pretty good.Ê Problem is I end up chasing it down after almost every use.Ê I've only got 3 modest sized rooms and a hallway.Ê It does better if I close the other 2 rooms, but the deluxe version is supposed to be able to handle it.When it works and finds its way back to its charging station, I give it 5 stars.Ê But, for the number of times I have to figure out where it's stalled, I can only give it 3."
09/10/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great Little Helper,"It turned out to be what we hoped it would. It (Robbie) really works out, we find the dust level in the whole house is down. We have been surprised at what he finds and picks up. Three weeks and no complaints."
8/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Good quality product!,"It really does pick up pet hair & dust very well. I would like to have more options to program & limit the size of the area to clean. With only 2 lighthouses it maneuvers into too many other areas in a hit & miss manner. Better to clean 1 room at a time more thoroughly.Ê Also needs a feature to have it move back & forth from the walls rather than in a criss cross, helter skelter manner.Meanwhile, I am very happy with the Roomba's cleaning quality.Ê I have breathing problems which make it difficult to do heavy cleaning so the Roomba keeps my asthma much calmer."
09/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,The product doesn't last long enough to make it worth the expense.,"It only worked well for 3 months.Ê Now it will barely vacuum for 3 or 4 minutes before getting stuck or having some malfunction.Ê I really loved it at first, but the product just doesn't last."
8/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,It does a wonderful job keeping the wood floors in my kitchen sparkling ...,"It keeps trying to escape through the kitchen down into the mud room, but gets hung up on the draft stopper on the entryway. It also continually tries to commit suicide down the stairs to the basement. Its 'oh no, stairs!' sensors apparently don't function well enough to keep this little fella out of trouble. It does a wonderful job keeping the wood floors in my kitchen sparkling clean of all the dog hair. When it gets carried away and wanders into the living room, it collects the animal hair into easy to pick up haystacks on the carpet. Considering the hair from my long-haired furkids would probably clog it every five minutes, I appreciate the effort it makes to keep the carpet cleaned."

01/07/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,stupid robot,"It is not so intelligent as irobot say. He spends several times in the same place and leaving others without cleaning. The return to base only happens if after 60 minutes it detects the signal from the base else or he ends the battery and is lost around the house, this happens if your house is large. The home base makes a ticking noise. I already communicated the manufacturer but they do not respond and the worst is that the site says to disconnect the battery when tick noise happens. So, my Roomba is turned off and the Irobot does nothing."

5/23/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,YOU DON'T GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"It is absolutely critical to wait for a few weeks before writing a review of a new product.Ê The iRobot Roomba 880 is absolutely fascinating for the first three days - I estimate we saved 15 minutes of vacuuming over that time, but easily spent 3 hours watching the thing cruise around our house.Ê My initial review would have read ""This thing is a gift from the Almighty!"".Ê However, after 10 days we are sadly returning the little guy whence it came.A quick note on our environment: we bought the 880 as part of a remodel project - new hardwood floors in our living room and kitchen.Ê We have 2 short hair labs, one short hair cat, two kids with hair of various lengths, two short hair parents, a guinnea pig, and a constant flow of messy friends and neighbors enjoying our living space.Ê The day after our new floors were finished it became apparent that we would either need to sweep 2x a day or get a robot to do the job.Ê We weren't expecting it to replace our need to vacuum, but were hoping it would be able to remove the majority of the pet hair, specifically.Before I slam this thing, let me tell you what I did like:Virtual Walls: the 880 comes with a pair of infrared beacons that can be used to create virtual walls, or 'halos' around places you don't want it to bother, like dog bowls.Ê These were very effective / easy to set up.Scheduling: I really liked the ability to set a daily schedule.Ê Great concept.Ê The entire point of a robotic vacuum is to reduce your interaction with the act of vacuuming - setting your schedule and interacting only when it needs you to empty its dustbin is a critical requirement in my book.Design: I'm a sucker for good looking tech, and would describe the Roomba as a good looking piece of hardware.Dust Bin: I had to empty the dustbin after two cleanings or so, and it was always full of pet hair.Ê I would prefer to empty once a week of course, but we have a zoo over here, so I thought it was fair.Ê At least I didn't have to empty it multiple times per cleaning.What I did NOT like:Noise: know that this thing is loud, specifically on hardwood floors (much quieter on carpet).Ê We have a TV in our kitchen, and we could not watch it while the little guy was running.Inefficient Cleaning Path: As I noted, I was fascinated watching this thing clean - I'd seriously crack a beer and just follow it around, trying to figure out its floor mapping algorithm.Ê After literally hours of watching it go, I believe it is totally random.Ê It would find and hug a wall, but then decide to veer off in a random direction.Ê The random approach to cleaning meant it would re-clean the same spots often, and leave others untouched.Ê I was hoping to see it learn over time, but it didn't - not over 10 days at least.Ê The end result is that it would run around MUCH longer than it needed. Combine gripes one and two, and you had a noisy device running around your house for hours - and this meant scheduling became a challenge.Ê I couldn't find 2 hours on any day that I could guarantee it wouldn't bother someone.Table and Chairs: The 880 was especially awful at figuring out our dining area - normal 4 legged table, 4 chairs and a bench. The robots sensor sees walls just fine, and slows down before impact - but not the case with skinny chair legs. The thing would head into our dining room with a head full of steam and smash full-on into our chairs, then proceed to bounce drunkenly around like a bull in a china shop - smashing into legs right and left. Yes, sometimes it pivots nicely around the leg - after its smashed into it full-speed in the first place.Random Stops: If we let the 880 run while we were gone, it seemed to invariably get stuck, stop, and ask for someone to move it - generally around our stairs.Ê I suspect that it had vertigo and would freak out on occasion when it felt it was going to fall down the stairs.Overall, I didn't have pie-in-the-sky hopes for this thing - honestly, I was just excited to have a freaking robot vacuuming my freaking floors.Ê That said, when I drop $700 large on a piece of tech, I expect the programming to have been a priority - and this is an area that needs improvement in my opinion.Ê I believe, quite strongly, that you are paying a brand premium for this thing that isn't deserved - compare the feature set to the like-priced Deebot D77 and you realize that iRobot is playing the brand game without pushing the envelope on functionality.Ê I'm waiting on my Deebot D77 (which is currently $70 off at Best Buy) to arrive and will update this post based on that experience.*****EDIT*****Well, our Deebot D77 showed up and we've used it religiously for about 2 weeks or so.Ê All I can say is that Robots seem a lot smarter in the movies - I was expecting Wall E, and instead I got a couple Battle Droids from Star Wars Episode 1.Ê Before I lament about my D77 experience, I'll just say that I do not believe either of these devices are worth their current price tags (~$700 USD as of this post).Ê I think it's a toss-up between the two honestly - I'm planning to keep the D77 primarily because A) our dark wood floors require daily vacuuming/sweeping, and B) I don't have the stomach to try another brand right now.Ê That said, what I like and what I don't:Likes:Base Canister: The D77's base vacuum canister is, hands down, the best feature this thing has - it's also the only feature I think it beats the Roomba 880.Ê We'll need to empty it 1-2 times a week as a standard.Ê This is much better than the every-couple-days-or-more bin emptying I was doing with the Roomba.Ê I've also used the vacuum canister for our stairs a few times - while it's functional, it's not super convenient (why o why didn't they add a small battery so you don't need to plug in for short use????).Noise: I do believe the D77 is quieter on our hardwood floors.Ê It's not super quiet, so don't think this is a dirt-whisperer.. just quieter than the Roomba.Cleaning Algorithm Options: the D77 has a number of additional cleaning options - you can tell it to hug the walls, go super-clean, or go normal - each altering the robot's cleaning path.Ê Note that I was not impressed with ANY of these - but options are nice, I suppose.Double spinners: while the Roomba only has one dirt spinner, the Deebot has two - this makes 2x the sense of having 1.Ê It did not result in a 2x better cleaning process, mind you.Dislikes:Inefficient Cleaning Path: I was seriously hoping this thing was smarter than it turned out to be.Ê But, alas, it's as dumb, maybe dumber, than the Roomba.Ê To be fair, the dirt sensor is a smart addition, and you can see it alter the D77's course when it encounters obvious dirt.Ê But my gripes about the Roomba's inefficient, seemingly random cleaning pattern are the same with the Deebot.Ê At $700, I expect these devices to have enough memory and processing power to A) do a great job at mapping their cleaning space, B) keeping track of where they are in that space, and C) figuring out what they have cleaned and what they haven't.Ê Instead, both bounce around randomly until they don't have any more juice.Ê This is about 2 hours for the D77.Ê I'll add, while both robots run full-speed into chair legs, the Roomba does a better job at sensing when it's about to run into a wall and slows down accordingly.Ê The Deebot, on the other hand, runs into walls full-speed consistently.Lack of scheduling options: the Deebot allows you to set a schedule, but only for the same time, every. stinking.Ê day.Ê That's not a typo.Ê While the Roomba 880 lets you pick both day of the week AND specific time per day, the Deebot only allows you to select 1 time, and then runs every day.Ê This sucks.Ê Understand that setting your schedule means you will have a loud vacuum running for 16 hours of your week.Easily stuck: the Deebot needs to be freed regularly.Ê It gets stuck on very low profile, low pile carpets, generally on the corner.Ê The Roomba did not get stuck once in the same places.Design: my wife likes the way the Deebot's shell looks while I prefer the look of the Roomba.Ê However, the digital interface is awful.Ê Simply awful.Ê So awful I needed to type this fact 3 times and am not doneÊ"

4/26/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,"a bit stupid, but does the job","It frequently gets stuck and runs out of power between the spokes of my office chair, and it spends a stupid amount of time trying to get over a half-inch high threshold between two rooms (outcome depends on angle of approach)--and then turning right around and trying to cross it again, and again, and again. ""Turn in a random direction"" is clearly a huge part of its programming, which appears stupid but is actually wise, since with purely deterministic programming, a programming error would result in certain areas of the floor consistently being passed over. With randomness, it cannot guarantee that it will cover the entire floor surface in one run, but it doesn't need to, since it can easily run daily and keep the floor clean through small consistent efforts. It does result in cleaner floors, but expect to have to rescue it frequently."

08/03/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great Job,"It clean extremely well,Ê i can't not compared it with previous models but this model cleans well and is not noisy, battery last quite some time and recycle bin is size is decent you will not have to empty the bin every pass. Of course that depends on the how dirty is the floor."
5/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,"Not the smartest robot, but does a great job cleaning (based on its bin)","It can't find its docking station even when I place it 1-5 feet away from it, straight out, facing the correct direction. Let alone after its done cleaning (it has no memory of where its been and where its docking station is.. it just hopes it can randomly find it again). But, it does a fantastic job picking up dust and short dog hair off of the hardwood, tile, AND carpet floors. There is a little sensor on top that prevents it (by 1/4 inch) from getting under several pieces of furniture. The total height off the ground, including sensor, is exactly 9 cm (or just over 3.54 inches)."
10/24/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Five Stars,Is my little helper
05/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Should come with every labrador puppy adoption,"Is it possible to write a 5-star review after only 1 days of use? Perhaps.I would have never spent this much on a vacuum, but we got a lab pup last year, and between the black hair she sheds and the two old cats we have that make my allergies worse, we really, really needed to vacuum more regularly. I am not a house cleaning kind of person, especially worse once I started working on my business from home - the housecleaning is never done. After our pup's first spring of shedding her entire coat (you labrador owners know what I'm talking about) the idea of a robotic vacuum was suddenly very enticing.Ê An Amazon search for Roomba brought up the latest 880 model, and the glowing reviews that all mentioned ""pet hair"" sealed the deal.For all new Roomba 880 owners, please be aware you have to contain your excitement at the unboxing ceremony, b/c it needs to be charged overnight before the first use. Really wish someone (ahem, other reviewers) said as much, but there you are, I've said it now.My place is about 900 sqft, split into two wings between the living room, which is raised 2 steps above the rest of the home, and all else. So we started the fully-charged-overnight Roomba in the carpeted living room. Did I mention I, er, don't really vacuum like I should? So we had to watch the little guy on its first run, since the red Full Bin light lit up every 5-10 minutes about the first 5 times. We ended up dumping the bin about a dozen times on that first run before it finally ran out of batteries, or maybe it finished, not sure. But hey, the living room floor is clean! And it looks like it was done with a proper vacuum by the H (not me, he vacuums more thoroughly than me). Our light beige carpet is beige, and light, again.I have no idea what is so enticing about watching this little guy, but it is. We usually watching a movie or catch a show at night, but not that night. All we did was watch the Roomba make random directions changes that apparently covered every square inch of the living room. Hopefully that fascination is going to fade - the whole point of getting a robot vacuum was so I could do something else while the vacuuming was done.Noise - really not bad, especially compared to a traditional vacuum. We easily had a normal-level conversation while the Roomba was doing its thing in the same room. The best comparison I could find is that the Roomba sounds like an electric pencil sharpener - that hum and whine and some small machinery spinning fast, but not much louder than that. And as soon as the Roomba went under the couch or bed, we could barely hear it at all, as if the upstairs neighbor was vacuuming.Pet reactions - the dog and two cats - all were curious, none scared. My pup, who's an energetic 13 months, couldn't care less about it after her first investigation, and we had to get her to move when the Roomba was heading for her. She got bumped a couple of times as she laid there on the floor with it. My excitable lab pup was totally unexcited by the Roomba. That tells you how non-threatening it is.Ê The cats actually seemed annoyed that they had to move when it came in their direction. In comparison, the cats are super wary of the upright vac, and the pup gets really excited around it, as well as our handheld vacuum.The next morning, used the Roomba in the master bedroom and that was a little more problematic - Roomba was not picking up very well, and decided it was done cleaning even though its batter was still charged and little clumps of puppy fur were scattered in trails all over the floor. This was my opportunity to figure out the Lighthouses/Virtual Walls, which were pretty simple. At least, simple after I read other reviews, not from reading the manual. Easy to set up, forcing the Roomba to clean the center of the room it kept missing. It preferred under the bed for some reason. I set up a ""wall"" by the bed so it wouldn't go under there (until the puppy knocked over the Lighthouse thingy when I was out of the room, so note that Lighthouses don't work when on its side). As the previous evening, I was emptying the bin frequently, maybe every 15-20 minutes, but it wasn't until I popped out the rollers and removed the spirals of hair in the ends did it start vacuuming properly again. I also cleaned the HEPA filter with the handheld vacuum, as other suggested.So less than 24 hours since its first use, we have all but the last bedroom vacuumed, and it feels good, like I did a ton of work and deserve a treat. Am certainly glad we got it, as we were contemplating hiring a housekeeper to make up for my anti-housework personality. But the Roomba will do for now. And it's cooler to say ""Yeah, we got a robot"" than to say ""Yeah, we got Roomba""."
4/28/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,It's like watching a drunken toddler vacuum your house.,"Is it just me or is this thing incapable of learning? If this is the best iRobot has to offer, they've got a long way to go.I'm a computer programmer and can imagine some fairly obvious ways to improve the 880's navigation algorithms. It doesn't seem to ""learn"" your room(s) at all. That could (and should) be accomplished by maintaining a reference map in memory that gets refined over time.Sure, there are always objects that will come and go, but your walls and most of your furniture stay where they are, right? So just imagine a large sheet of graph paper where the Roomba simply records the obstructions it finds. Once developed, the 880 could (and should) create a much more logical and efficient route based on that map.But no, each run is a random series of pinball-like zig-zags. At the end of the hour, we commonly find large areas that went uncleaned. Today, for example, the Roomba spent all of its time in a single part of our main floor. It failed to re-find the bathroom or our laundry room as it has done in the past.This can only be explained by poor programming.Meanwhile, the 880 keeps dragging shoes around by their shoestrings, getting stuck on top of power cables, certain pieces of decor and the legs of one very expensive piece of furniture that we have to remember to put atop a sofa so it won't get damaged. When the Roomba encounters these objects, it tries to free itself but it appears to not remember those problem areas and therefore fails to learn from them.Again, this can only be explained by poor programming.We always keep our shoes next to the front door. And whenever we forgot to tuck their shoelaces inside, the 880 will choke on them. What it should be doing instead is to avoid that area after 2 or 3 times. So on that imaginary map, just imagine marking those problem areas with a red ""keep-out"" sign. Our solution is to purchase a couple of those iRobot Keep-Off mats, and we'll see how that works.One comical anecdote for you: One morning the 880 went into the bathroom and shut the door. My wife said, ""maybe its bin is full and it needs to take a dump."" To which I replied, ""Yeah, it took the accessories brochure in there so it could be a while.""Ê :)All in all we love the idea of the Roomba, and the 880 was probably worth waiting for. But we expected to see more adaptive AI from this productÊ especially from a company that also makes military products."
1/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Awesome!,"IRobot, Kudos. I was skeptical earlier, but now, I will look at your other home products with serious interest!"
12/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Disappointing High-End Robot,"iRobot is probably considered within the home robot industry to be the defacto standard of what is best.Ê My purchase of the Roomba 880 in June 2015 however did not meet my expectations based on praises by many reviewers, both within the home robot industry and on sites like Amazon.Ê I had decided to purchase a Roomba as a replacement for my original Neato XV-11 which has served me very well for over five years.Ê After now having the Roomba for six months, I can definitely say that I wish I had listened to my instincts and gone with another Neato.What Ive observed over the last six months:- quieter operation than my XV-11- dirt detection does cause the robot to focus on cleaning soiled areas more- dust bin is adequately large- rollers do not tangle with hair such that the rollers are impeded, however hair does build up within the rollers themselves and does require regular clearing- AeroForce Extraction with AirFlow Accelerator works okay on carpet but does not work well on hard surfaces with small debris, i.e. artificial christmas tree needles- multi-room cleaning is limited to 20 minutes per room and requires Lighthouses; room-to-room navigation and return to base is not reliable.- Virtual Walls do not reliably contain the robot- due to the random cleaning pattern, even after several cleaning cycles in an area, not all of the area will be cleaned- side brush is mostly useless on carpet; works okay on hard surfaces; when not along a wall and on hard surfaces, debris tends to be thrown out of the path of the robot instead of into the cleaning path leaving the debris to maybe be collected on another path- to effectively clean a room I find myself rearranging much of the room to allow the robot to clean, i.e. putting chairs up on tables, moving ottoman, clearing anything on the floor- impact of robot bumper on furniture and other items is strong enough that it can knock items over and/or off of furniture if not a solid pieceAfter six months of regular use I cannot recommend the Roomba 880.Ê I strongly feel that the $700 spent on this robot could have been saved and a much cheaper Roomba.Ê Another Roomba without the Aeroforce Extraction, AirFlow Acceleration, multi-room features would have provided the same experience.Ê Alternatively, and what I wish I had done, is to get another Neato and have a robotic vacuum which actually does clean the house to the point of nearly replacing an upright.Ê In short, the Roomba 880 has been both frustrating and disappointing."
8/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Another great product from iRobot!,"iRobot has always out top quality products. The Roomba 880 follows tradition. Love the rollers instead of brushes. Easy to program, easy to empty and overall easy to use."
06/06/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Dust and Hair magnet!,"Initially hesitant at the price of the 880, but so far it's worth it.Ê Have had the 880 for less than a week, but it's cleaned all rooms in the house and has picked up an amazing amount dust and dog hair.Ê Was completely surprised by how much hair and dust this picked up from our family room which was vacuumed the day before we let the Roomba loose.Ê The family room is our high traffic room where we spend most of our time and where our dog lays out.Ê We have to constantly vacuum this room and do a carpet cleaning (Hoover MaxExtract cleaner) once every couple of months due to our little furball and foot traffic.Ê We've let the Roomba loose on this room four times now, and it's filled it's bin every time with hair and dust.Ê The carpet looks clean, but it's still pulling up very fine hair and dust.Ê One of the best things about the Roomba is it'll vacuum under our couches and beds, places that are difficult to clean under.We have carpet, hardwood, black granite and dark gray slate floors in different areas of the house and so far there have not been any issues on any of these surfaces.Ê The Roomba has not had a problem rolling over computer power cords and has not sucked up throw rugs either.Ê It has stopped and had to be resarted a few times on stair edges where it went charging towards the stairs and stopped just short of going over the edge. There has been one instance of it going past one of the lighthouses which was in virtual wall mode.Ê Repositioned the lighthouse and it didn't pass it again.Our house is two story, multi-level so moving the Roomba and base from room to room is our mode of operation.Ê Have not had to program the Roomba yet and actually don't see a need to do so since we move it from room to room.With regards to noise, I expected this to be noisier based on some of the reviews, but it's not an issue so far.Ê Granted we don't run this in the room we're using, but even so it's not noisy to the point that it'll drown out conversation or an audio source.Ê It's definitely quieter than both our Miele and Panasonic canister vacs.Complaints?Ê It doesn't do stairs...Ê The only real complaint is that the dirt bin is small, but given the size of the Roomba, making it bigger would mean making the Roomba bigger.Ê Overall considering we don't have to push our vacuums around it's definitely a win."
09/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,this thing is fantastic. However,"In theory, this thing is fantastic.Ê However, for $600 I'm actually pretty disappointed with it for several reasons.First, the dirt bin is ridiculously undersized!Ê I have just one dog, a lab who sheds moderately, and I use Roomba every single day.Ê The dirt bin requires emptying every single day.Ê But that isn't the problem.Ê The problem is that the opening is so narrow that the dirty, dusty clump of dog hairÊ NEVER empties out easily, no matter how much I bang it on the garbage can.Ê I either have to stick a finger in to pull the gross chuck of dirt/hair out, or I started using a toothbrush to do this.Ê Either way, it's a messy and gross job.Ê I much preferred my bagless and easy-to-empty regular vacuum bin.Second, the batteries in the lighthouse/wall towers lasted less than 3 months.Ê There is no way to turn these off when not in use, so this is going to get expensive to keep replacing the batteries.Third, Roomba OFTEN gets stuck at the top of our carpeted stairs.Ê It is supposed to be savvy enough to be able to handle this, but my Roomba is apparently a slow learner.Ê And I wipe of the sensors at least twice a week.Ê So I often come home to find a stuck Roomba that only partially cleaned my floor while I was gone.Fourth, and most irritatingly, after less than 3 months of use, the wheels have started making an extremely annoying high-pitched squeaking sound.Ê I took the whole thing about and can't figure out how to fix this.Ê I believe the squeal is coming the tiny motors that drive the wheels, so it's not even something I can fix with WD-40.Ê I hope this is covered under warranty, because I'm going to have to get this serviced, which is really annoying.I do love coming home from work and NOT seeing dog hair sticking up from my carpets like grass (like I used to see every day), but I'm starting to wonder if this Roomba thing is more hassle than helpful."
11/07/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Make life easier!,"In the beginning, I wasn't sure if I liked it.Ê But after using it every morning for about 20 to 30 minutes, the floors are devoid of dog hair and dust!Ê It is so easy and does such a great job, that I haven't used my big vac in a while.Ê I just steam mop every week or 10 days.Ê Initially, I had to empty the bin a lot during the cycle.Ê Now, usually I just empty it, clean the sensor windows and the rollers AFTER it is through.Ê Then it is ready for the next day.Ê I have mostly tile floors and a few area rugs.Ê Very happy with this purchase."
3/26/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Love,In love
11/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Forgot docking station location....,In less then one year my 880 forgot where it's docking station is after cleaning the room. I'm ticked because now I have to search two rooms on my hands and knees looking for it now.
4/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,What a remarkable device,"If you've never used a robotic vacuum, you'll love how effective and simple it is, and you'll never want to go back. If you used one before, you'll love how durable and easy-to-maintain the 880 is. It can be programmed to clean while you're away, and it gets into tight spaces. The beacons can limit the Roomba to a specific room or region if you like, and it recharges itself when it's finished. It's quite expensive, and it won't clean as deeply as a top-of-the-line upright vacuum, but it's definitely the best robotic vacuum around."
12/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,A few tips for pet owners.,"If you have indoor pets, use it every day. If you use it less often, you will have to babysit the dust bin every ten minutes. If there is a lot of hair on the floor, here is what happens: The dust bin fills with hair quickly, also, the outlet from the vac in to the dust bin gets clogged with hair. You need to check it every ten minutes in this scenario, empty the bin and un-clog the outlet.Ê The more often you use it, the less hair on the floor, the less you have to check it. We have six dogs and I only use the Roomba when I am here to monitor it. I never fire it up unattended. If you have less hair on the floor, you may be able to use it unattended, or check the bin less often. Our bathrooms are pretty hair free, so I stick it in there, fire it up, shut the door, and go get it in 15 minutes. It won't get clogged or need monitoring in that scenario. Even checking it often, it is less work than hand vacuuming. Our floors have never been cleaner! We used to wait until the floors were pretty disgusting before vacuuming and dust mopping, so we lived with nasty floors most of the time. Now the floors are almost spotless all the time. Having clean floors is very satisfying and reduces your background level of stress and angst, this is the best feature of the Roomba. Another interesting side effect is that since the floors are so clean, we find ourselves keeping the entire house tidier and more organized to ""go with"" the clean floors! My sister has one with bristle brushes while the 880 has the non bristled extractors. She tells me she has to clean those brushes a lot, this unit does not have that issue. It's worth every penny."
09/01/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,Poor pet hair performance,If you have dogs that shed - this unit is worthless.Ê I have a 645 and it's fantastic.Ê I got this one and am thoroughly disappointed.Ê It does not pick up german shepherd hair long or short.Ê The full bin indicator is fooled by pet hair.Ê The improvements actually make this unit much worse than the 600 series.Ê You may have to pick hair out of brushes - but at least the 600 series will pick up pet hair very well.
12/07/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,WRETCHED MACHINE!!,"If you have a combination of hardwood floors and area rugs, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING THIS PRODUCT!Ê I had to rescue this wretched machine 5 times in the same room as it got caught in the transition area between the area rug and the hardwood floor. And don't get me started about the machine finishing a room...It never did!! It would go off and leave one room and start another. Neat idea but frustrating to watch and more frustrating to untangle it from cords and tree skirts."
05/06/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Best gift I have ever bought for myself!!!,"If you are on the fence about buying an iRobot vacuum, don't waste another minute and get one asap!! You will be doing yourself the biggest favor!!!Ê Also, if you're contemplating splurging on the newest model, the 880, I would highly recommend it.Ê I got the 770 model right before the 880 one came out...and boy its great!Ê Both clean well, but the 880 cleans quieter.Ê Best of all, it requires less on my part because the bristles of the older model are a pain in the butt to clean and maintain.Ê Now, I keep my 770 upstairs and the 880 downstairs.The only cons about the 880 to me are that...1.Ê The red empty bin light seems to come on faster and more frequently than the 770...and it constantly lights up even when there is barely anything in the bin.Ê Even after I have cleaned the filter and cleared the extractors, the red light sometimes is still on and I will just turn the unit off then turn it back on to get rid of the red annoying light.2.Ê When you empty the bin, most times there will be dust or debris that was halfway from the extractors and halfway into the bin...but the opening of the bin motion causes the dust to break up and fall onto the ground....so half the time before the unit stops cleaning, there is still dirt that didn't make it to the bin yet....so you end up with a little mess every time you try to empty the bin.Ê I do not have that problem with the 770."
1/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,"From clean sweep to Star Wars, it's a big hit.","If you are looking for a robot cleaning tool that performs a clean sweep, then this is it.Ê Now, I'm not going to say that it will match one of the highly rated vacuum cleaners that you push, pull, and use with a multitude of different instruments.Ê It doesn't.Ê But it is a good labor saving tool. The Roomba 880 (or other circular type robot) will not get in a corner,...it just can't.Ê It's ROUND.Ê However, we run the 880 every 2 - 3 days in the living room, kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms, and hallway on the main floor.Ê Sometimes we use the barriers that come with it to limit the space it cleans, and sometimes we just let it roam freely.Ê It cleans acceptably and keeps the use of other vacuum cleaners to a minimum.Ê Just make sure that the Roomba is emptied after every use, that you pick up / move any electrical cords, and that you know how to set the timing device.Ê It can be disconcerting to be wakened at 3:00 AM with the Roomba making its rounds.Ê Also, if you have an alarm system that senses movement, that might be a problem, though our system has not been set off as yet by the Roomba.Ê Just something to think about.Ê When the Roomba begins to run out of electricity it will go immediately to it's docking station,...just like one of the space ships in Star Wars.Ê This model is expensive, but it certainly put a smile on my wife's face."
06/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,We love our Roomba 880...,"If anyone would have told me I could be a hero for buying a vacuum cleaner, I wouldn't have believed it. The Roomba 880 is simply awesome. It works on a programmed schedule. Handles pet hair well and covers our entire floor. Moves amazingly well from hardwood to rugs to carpet. If a room doesn't need cleaning or isn't picked up you just shut the door or use one of the virtual barriers. They work well.You do need to make sure loose items like shoe laces and blind pulls are picked up but it is far more tolerant of obstacles than I thought it would be as it moved from room to room. The bin is small but that reflects its size. This is a great product."
11/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,I am largely satisfied with its performance,"I've used this robot vacuum cleaner regularly for 10 months now.Ê Except for its few shortcomings, I am largely satisfied with its performance.Ê I think that its positives, especially the fact that it needs very little supervision, far outweigh its negatives.Ê First the negatives:1.Ê Sometimes it will return to its docking station for a recharge after completing a run.Ê Other times it simply stops in place and must be placedÊ directly in front of the docking station and ordered to dock.Ê Even then it will sometimes wander off and start cleaning again.Ê I think that Roomba's docking smarts need some refinement.2.Ê It is not designed to properly clean a wood floor in a carpeted corridor with a band of wood on each side narrower than Roomba.Ê In that case it leans at an angle from the elevated carpet to the wood floor and is unable to make full contact with the wood floor.Ê I am then forced to roll up the carpet so that Roomba has the room to vacuum the wood floor thoroughly.3.Ê I have 1"" diameter bent steel sled chairs.Ê Instead of bouncing off the the sled base as it does off of larger objects, Roomba will sometimes try to cross the base and will get hung up and cry for help.Ê Its object sensors should be more sensitive to such smaller objects and not try to climb or cross them.Some owners have complained about the noise generated by Roomba as it goes about its business.Ê Since it's much quieter than a conventional vacuum cleaner, I don't mind the noise level at all.Ê Robot vacuum cleaners with a spinning brush are all unable to reach into about the last inch of an interior corner.Ê That's why its best to quickly sweep out interior corners with a small whisk broom before letting Roomba loose.Ê To get the best results out of Roomba, it's important to do a bit of furniture movement so that Roomba has room to squeeze between and behind things.Ê Roomba takes much longer to vacuum a room than it would take to do so manually with a conventional machine.Ê I see that as a positive feature, because, as random as it appears to be, Roomba will repeatedly visit all areas of a room from multiple directions.Ê In the end, it appears to do a more thorough job of vacuuming than would a bored human operator.Ê I don't mind cleaning out the dust compartment after every workout.Ê This chore is a good way to get a sense of how much dust and hairs Roomba has picked up."
6/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"and I really like it, although it is a bit high maintenance","I've used it for over 6 months, and I really like it, although it is a bit high maintenance.Ê Does a great job picking up cat litter and cleaning carpets, but does need emptying and cleaning after a couple of runs to keep it working at its best.Ê It's really nice to be able to set it up to clean an area while you are busy elsewhere.Works great cleaning under beds and furniture with at least 4"" clearance.I've had to change the HEPA filter out about every month (I run mine almost daily in a ~120 sq ft area around a litter box), so it can be pricey if you stick with the OEM filters.Ê I've had no problems using cheaper replacements, but they likely are not true HEPA filters.Ê It's not a big concern for me, since I bought it primarily to pick up cat litter."
01/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,"A cleaner house for less effort, but not worth the price due to too much inattention to its design.","I've used it for 2 weeks now, and it's strengths and weaknesses have become quite apparent.Like other reviewers have noted, strengths include1) it doesn't procrastinate cleaning, and sticks to its programmed schedule and I do procrastinate, so my house is cleaner with it. It picks up a surprising amount of something (worn out fibers, lint, hair, dust from the carpet, but not that much from solid floors). But, it's getting something from running vs. nothing from when I procrastinate. That's a big plus.2) it gets under baseboards, couches, the bed with a vengeance, and I basically don't do them well if at all, and so dust bunnies have headed for the hills.3) I have it do smaller rooms, like the bathroom or den, by tossing it in, closing the door, and coming back for it 5-10 minutes later, and the throw rugs, and under the couch and behind the door are all clean and neat, and it's overcome my procrastination again, and so the house is cleaner still.4) it's cute and fun to watch if you're bored.5) it's relatively quiet, enough so that I can watch tv without turning up the volume.Ê Ok, my hearing is not great, and I have the volume up aways already, but it's way quieter than my Hoover.The minuses include1) it misses spots, sometimes small, sometimes half of an entire room; the light house seems to make it skip large chunks of rooms and go in to neighboring ones instead.2) it doesn't map out space at all, goes over the same spot repeatedly while missing the small or big chunks3) it uses up a lot of time.Ê With it missing a lot it takes ~1 hour to do maybe 1000 sq. ft of contiguous space (LR, DR, kitchen), and getting almost everything it takes 2.5 hours.Ê I can vacuum and dust mop the same area in about 10-15 minutes.4) it gets lost and can't find it's way back to the base sometimes, without the light house. And with the light house it seems to get confused and has just done 'doughnuts' where it spins around 360's incessantly trying to figure out where the light house is and can't 'get a fix' and so stays lost.5) when the dust bin light is on saying it's full - it keeps running.6) one time the entire dust bin fell out while it was running - I thought I had clicked it back in to place after the prior cleaning, but odds are I hadn't. And the machine kept running with the bin sitting on the floor, and the gadget spewing dust and dirt back in to the room. THAT is the ultimate in stupid design.Bottom line: it's not the Jetson's Rosie, and instead it needs a fair amount of supervision.Overall, if it cost $250. I'd give it 5 stars.Ê For $350. I'd give it 4-4.5 stars. For $700. it gets 3 stars. Cadillacs get judged on a higher standard than Pintos or the like. For big bucks, I expect near perfection attention to detail.The serious details Roomba didn't attend to: having no 'interlock' to prevent it from running without a dust bin, or when it's full, no adequate room mapping system, light houses that don't work well if at all, and it's subsequent inefficient use of time."
10/26/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Outstanding for daily carpet cleaning w/ pets,"I've owned 3 Roomba's, and this is by far my favorite.Ê Much better for carpets with animal hair.Ê Keeping the previous ones free of binding hairs on previous models took several minutes of maintenance for each cleaning (2 dogs + 2 cats).Ê Cleaning the rollers on this one is a piece of cake, and it never binds up.Ê My only issue is that the battery has recently stoppedÊ charging, which I'm hoping is just a battery problem and not a robot issue.Ê The troubleshooting steps from the iRobot website haven't helped.Ê I have a trouble ticket into iRobot right now--waiting to hear back from them."
11/18/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Remarkable difference from the earlier versions,"I've only had this robot for 2 weeks.Ê I had an earlier version several years ago and was not impressed.Ê Therefore, I was hesitant to buy this one.Ê Remarkable difference,Ê love the rollers compared to the brushes much easier to maintain.Ê It hasn't got stuck, always find it at its base.Ê I clean 2-3 rooms a day.Ê Works as advertised.Ê I have a small air compressor that blows at 25psi.Ê I use it to clean the filter and dirt bin.Ê When I hold the filter up to a light I can still see thru it and it still looks new."
12/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Can you give 6 Stars?!,"I've only had him for a week but it could be the greatest invention EVER!Ê To set the scene:Ê I have 2 very hairy golden retrievers and live in a warm climate - 2 hairy dogs + warm climate = LOTS OF SHEDDING!Ê I mean tumbleweed shedding!Ê To add to the issue, I am both an asthmatic on fairly serious meds and am allergic to pretty much everything including but not limited to oxygen.Ê We have a maid who comes and cleans twice a month.Ê She is here for about 4 hours (1900 sf) and does a thorough job.Ê I always feel better for the first couple of days after she has been here.Roomba arrived and we set him up to charge.Ê We live in a one floor beach house that has a one step drop down in a small area that leads to the back.Ê Roomba has navigated our living room, bar room, hallways, kitchen and one of the bedrooms (we keep him out of the guest room).Ê The very first day, Roomba (still haven't named him yet) did a full cleaning and it took about and hour and a half.Ê His receptacle was full at about the 1/2 way point.Ê Fortunately I was home and I emptied him.Ê I was curious to see if the next day he would fill up given the previous day's cleaning.Ê The next day I came home and Roomba had completed his task and receptacle was only 1/2 full.He gets under our bed and our living room furniture with ease.Ê The most important thing we have found is that he is very gentle with our walls and furniture but he still gets right up to them.Ê We have leather restoration hardware chairs, sofas, and ottomans. . . . . no issues with dings at all.On day three, I noticed a marked difference in my breathing and ""stuffiness.""Ê Today is day 5 and I am LOVING HIM!!!!I will happily update in the future if it warrants, but as of today, I am screaming at the top of the world, BUY A ROOMBA 880!"

The roomba has not scratched our flooring or the wood thresholds while transitioning from wood to tile.Ê It does better than I expected on our area rugs, but I still have to vacuum those with my dyson (expected with 2 dogs).Ê Good battery life. It is quieter than anticipated during operation.Ê The only complaint would be that it scratches too easily. A part of the roomba wedged its way under my couch somehow and was scratched heavily on the faceplate as it tried to escape a few days after buying it. The placement pieces of all kinds are available for a good price though.This is not meant to replace your normal vacuuming,especially if you have pets that shed.Ê It does a great job on a daily basis, allowing me to cut down on dry mopping multiple times per day."
5/17/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,The best Roomba yet,"I've had several Roombas.Ê They all did a decent job, but were a big pain to clean.Ê I have two dogs, one sheds like crazy and frequently I have two four legged houseguests that are even worse.Ê With all four here I have to vacuum every day, mostly carpet. It takes maybe two minutes to clean the 880.Ê I concentrate on the master bedroom and the living room.Ê Very happy with this product.Ê I did try the Neato, but it had electronics problems, but they did replace them, 6 or 7 times.Ê I finally got sick of going to Fed Ex every few weeks and went back to Roomba."
10/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I love this thing beyond all reason,"I've had my 880 for about 6 weeks now.Ê I use it 2 or 3 times per week as my giant Doberman is a shedding machine, plus I live in FL, so the sand grit he tracks in daily is an added nightmare.Ê I love this thing beyond all reason.Ê I have gained back hours of time by not having to vacuum by hand so often.Ê I use it manually rather than scheduling because it's easier for me to break off the house into sections...I clear the obstacles out of the way and use the lighthouses so it does a room or two at a time.Ê It has only gotten stuck once, tangled in some smaller cords that I now know have to be up off the floor.Ê One other time, I noticed it kept leaving a little pile of dirt when I picked it up and the bin was nearly empty despite knowing the floors had plenty of dog hair on them that was now gone.Ê Very odd.Ê Discovered that long human hair had gotten wrapped around the roller bars so they weren't turning and tossing dirt into the bin.Ê It was all crammed up into the cavity behind the roller bars, thus falling when I picked it up.Ê Once the long hair removal restored free rolling, no more issue.Ê I clean the bin and bang dust out of the filter on every use, so no issues with bin size or reduced air flow due to clogged filter.Ê The lighthouses are a bit of a mystery, sometimes being the virtual wall they're set to be and sometimes not.Ê Not that big a deal since I'm home when it's running.Ê I have tried to make sense of the random pattern, but there doesn't seem to be any...guess I don't really care as long as the whole room gets cleaned and it does. I was going to name it Mrs. Hughes after my favorite character on Downton Abbey, but no woman would ever clean in such a random fashion, so it became Carson instead.Ê :)"

I'm not sure ...,I've had it for two weeks.Ê I'm not sure about it.Ê It only runs an hour and then returns for recharging.Ê One hour is not long enough to do the floor especially since it goes over the same spots over and over again and misses others.Ê It does small rooms really well.Ê It picks up really well.Ê Our floors are very clean (no shoes allowed) and it still picks up dust as can be seen in the filter.Ê The haphazard pattern it use is perplexing.
07/04/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Helpful but needlessly cleans low traffic walls repeatedly,"I've had it for three weeks and I have tiled floors and two cats. I also use it for only two rooms about 450sq.ft total. It definitely helps pick up a 1/4 bin of cat hair, dander, etc per day. But it still leaves behind some debris at the bottom of my feet.While observing it, it needlessly over-cleans the same perimeter 4+ times, wasting battery and it does not go to the places I want it to go. As I am writing this, I have left it on for about an hour and it has yet to clean the area under my feet. It has already wanted to dock. When you think about it, I would have been done using a regular vacuum and covered hard to reach spots like the corners and walls. It does not seem capable of adequately cleaning more than 2 rooms before it wants to dock.I've seen videos comparing coverage in one room vs other products and while I don't disbelieve it, people will miss the details. It might cover all spots, but on many high traffic spots, it goes over it only once, while it goes over many low traffic spots like the wall needlessly over and over and over and over again. It also may not cover all walls with the brushed side.This leads to the other problem with having only one side brush. I've seen so many instances where multiple brushes would be effective. I've seen it clean perimeters / walls with the brushless side and it never comes back to clean that area with the brushed side.It also scratches itself pretty good on the sides and bottom on the first use. So it would be odd to return it if you're not satisfied.But, when I'm not home, it helps eliminate a lot of cat hair and debris from my feet for the most part. It's also quieter than what I've read and seen from various videos online. I can still let it run when I'm in the room doing work. As much as I complain about it, it's probably the best out there and helps a lot on LIGHT jobs. The price definitely hurts.Note, I've never used any other robot vacuum as a comparison.UPDATE: after six months of using it, I spilled baby bird food (powder) on my tiled floor. The vac does not have enough suction to clean powder in the grout. Even after several passes, it does not clean the mess. I think a brush is needed. Also, the rubber bumpers around the edge of the unit eventually wears off on your furniture. My leather furniture has rubber marks all along the side and my speaker grill is worn.But, customer service is excellent."
07/06/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Loving it so far.,"I've had it for about a month and its really working out for my relatively small New York apartment.I've been trying to gingerly warm my Roomba up to the task of cleaning the apt, not sure of how cautious I need to be.Ê For example, I started by putting my curtains which brush against the floor, up and off the ground, just in case the Roomba were to ingest the bottom and then try to rip them off the wall.Ê After watching it a few times I realized that didn't seem to be a concern, and now I don't bother - curtains are still up on the wall.It does have a way with cords, however, but that only inspires me to have better cable management, so it actually works out well.I have a tripod lamp, however, and it won't seem to play well with those precarious legs - I've put a heavy book near the tripod, which seems to keep the Roomba at bay - clever thinking like this seems to get around most issues.I also have a new jute rug.Ê Haven't owned some crappy rugs in the past that always shed unbelievable amounts, I finally spent a bit more in the hopes that it wouldn't shed as much, if at all.Ê However, every time the Roomba goes over the rug, the bin gets filled with rug-fluff very quickly.Ê I THINK, that its getting better - the Roomba is managing to return to its dock without a full bin more than before - but its something I'll keep an eye on.Ê So to recap with a future buyer, a new rug might limit the Roomba's practicality until it stops shedding.Lastly, only one piece of furniture that I own seems to make the Roomba get stuck - it happens to have a cross-member at PRECISELY the right height for the Roomba to wedge itself in.Ê When it does, I simply have to extricate the Roomba and return it to its dock.Ê Not the end of the world.Ê However, I've taken both of the virtualwalls and placed them between the legs of the piece of furniture the Roomba gets stuck on, underneath it so they aren't as obvious, and the frequency with which it gets stuck there has reduced dramatically.All in all, a great way for a clean-but-lazy person to stay both clean and lazy."
08/10/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,Garbage. Can't be relied on to work consistently.,"I've had 2 Roomba 880s now and they both do the same damn thing. Every 5th or 6th cleaning cycle in my tiny 450' apartment the 880 gets stuck in the last room and keeps going around in circles until it runs out of power. I know there is a problem as soon as I see that the ""dock"" light is on an this idiotic piece of garbage repeatedly (10-20 times) goes up to the lighthouse and, instead of crossing over and finding it's way back to the docking station, turns around and goes right back into the room. It does this over and over again until the battery light comes on and it runs out of power (invariably in the most inconvenient spot possible under a drawer or the bed). I've already replaced this piece of crap once and the new one does exactly the same thing. It's no surprise that this company is producing garbage sinceÊ it's a subsidiary of Bose which is a company that spends massive resources on a marketing campaign designed to mislead people into believing that it's substandard speakers are superior."

It needed the bin cleaned out every day for about a week, now after three weeks it only needs dumped about every three days.

04/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,I would love to have a robot vacuum if the energy consumption ...,"I've been evaluating this model because of all the positive reviews on Amazon. A friend owns this model and kindly loaned it to me for evaluation. I can see where the enthusiasm comes from but I'm not convinced. The robot is limited by its battery power supply. The overwhelming power design is consumed by its mobility. In other words, the robot spends most of its energy walking rather than vacuuming. The vacuum is so weak that it will repeatedly go over dust or dirt that the weakest vacuum picks up at first try. In my opinion, the robot is not balanced in energy consumption for vacuuming and mobility.The majority of positive reviewers are probably sold by a full dust bin. Yes, if you let the robot runs continually, it will get the bin full. Therefore, it gives the user a satisfying moment after a duty cycle. However, the bin is small or tiny. I even suspect that it's intentionally made tiny to elicit such reactions: to see the robot is constantly harvesting dirt. A psychological benefit mostly drives the positive review. In reality, the users have to keep the robot running probably daily to keep a house clean. The labor for other vacuum goes to clean this machine and maintenance with so much frequency of running the robot.I would love to have a robot vacuum if the energy consumption for actually vacuuming and walking is balanced. The suction should pick up dirt apparent and please give me a bigger bin."

7/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Excellent for hairy dog owners!,"I'm really impressed with this little guy so far. We bought the ""bells and whistles"" model as we have a super hairy Golden Retriever. We just moved into a new house with all wood floors so after we unpacked I set the Roomba going to test it out. I wasn't expecting too much as we had only just moved in and the house was spotless. I'm consistently surprised at just how much hair and dust this picks up! It really is amazing. I just set it going in the morning or when I am heading out somewhere and I come back to see that it is full. Even when the floor looks super clean it manages to find dust and hair. If you have a hairy dog I really recommend getting one of these."
4/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Does a great job,"I'm quite impressed with this little guy.Ê The first few times I ran it, I was shocked at how much dust and dirt was on a carpet I had recently cleaned with a normal upright vacuum cleaner.Ê Now it runs a daily cycle while I am at work through the rooms I use the most.Ê For the rest of the house I simply move it and run cleaning cycles more occasionally.My upright vacuum is now mainly used for spots the Roomba can't reach, and for cleaning the Roomba himself.Ê I'd definitely recommend using a vacuum to clean the filter (drawing air across the surface, not through it, or you could damage the filter from the pressure difference).Ê Tapping the filter clean is a sure-fire way to kick a lot of dust into the air.One other point of note - Roomba really helps you keep your living space clean in two ways.Ê The first is obvious, by cleaning the floors.Ê The second, though, is almost more powerful - it helps instill good cleaning practices in its humans.Ê What do I mean by that?Ê Well, if you have a cluttered room, you're going to clean it before Roomba can do its job.Ê Once you see just how useful Roomba is and just how much dust it's gathering, you're going to want to run Roomba regularly - preferably daily through the rooms you use the most.Ê You will quickly get in the habit of checking daily for clutter and dealing with it.Ê That's a good habit, and it tends to spread out from there - now that you've got the floor under control and spend only a brief time keeping it that way, clutter or dust above the floor seems more noticeable and you now have the time to actually tackle it.Ê If you feel like you're always falling behind at keeping the house clean, this can really help you get caught up and instill the habits you need to stay caught up."

But I can grab it by it's convenient handle, take it down to the family room, turn it on and close the door.Ê I come back later to a clean room."

7/21/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Hire a house keeper instead.,I would not recommend this to wool carpet owners.Ê The robot 880 has shredded 2 different hand woven wool rugs.Ê The 'dust sensor' registers the carpet as dirty and it keeps going over the same spot again and again.Ê Furthermore the 'brushless' nature of the rollers are rubber and it just yanks up the fibers.Ê The reason I'm giving it a three and not a one is that hand woven wool rugs aon top of hardwoods is probably not the norm for people.Ê I does a fair job on the hardwoods picking up the majority of the dust and does a good job on standard residential synthetic carpet.Ê this is not a replacement for regularly cleaning but keeps the dust bunnies down.Ê The external room sensors to exclude or include rooms are challenging to set up as well is the vacuum.Ê Doesn't seem to me like it would be a big stretch to include wi fi and a more friend app.Ê I would not recommended this purchase.
12/12/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,cleans the floor better than my previous vacuum,I would give it 5 stars if the remote worked.

I have to keep the remote perfectly pointed in a straight line directly at the roomba or else it stops.
06/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Surprisingly pleased with this purchase!,"I work full time and have hardwood and carpeted floors.Ê Although I have not taken time yet to actually program the Roomba 880 for regular cleaning, I find I have been using it almost every day when I am getting ready for work.Ê I have a clean house and no kids, but I do have a non-shedding dog. The best thing about it is that it goes under my tables, chairs, beds and couches and picks up the dust bunnies. It does go over my fringed area rugs easily, and if it gets ""stuck"" after a minute or so, it gets ""unstuck"" and continues on its' way.Ê When I have company, after they leave, I close the door to the bedroom (carpeted) and let it work.Ê It covers EVERY inch, except maybe the deep corners --Ê I can see the ""tracks"".Ê The other really great feature is that I have baseboard heating and the Roomba is able to run along the heaters and sweep out the dust underneath them for vacuuming.Ê I like it."
04/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Comparison between Roomba 880 and Neato BotVac from a long time robot vacuum user,"I won't cover the basics of what a robot will / won't do in general, but I've been a long time user of an older model Roomba 500 series, looking for a new toy. I bought the BotVac first and then decided to try the Roomba 880 later after being dissatisfied with some aspects of the BotVac.-- The short version --Best robot vacuum I've EVER tested, and I've tested a lot. The only concern I would have is picking up flat and heavy objects from hardwood -- the new rollers don't seem to work as well as brushes for hardwood surfaces, though they more than make up for this in convenience. This is the first robot where I truly consider it ""virtually maintenance free"".4/5 stars only for price. Although it's superior, I don't think it's so superior that it commands nearly double the average price for a robot vacuum. I have found the Neato BotVac's deliver close to the Roomba's performance for far less cost.-----When I went from the Roomba 595 to the Botvac 65, I thought that Botvac beat the crap out of the Roomba. The Roomba would often get stuck under chairs and spend 20 minutes spinning around freeing itself. With no lighthouses, it was very hard to convince the Roomba to thoroughly clean a 2 bed 2 bath apartment. It would either prematurely return to the base without touching half the place, or try to clean too much and die before getting back to the base, etc. And the brush/roller got so dirty and worn with just a few weeks of usage that I was spending more time cleaning gross dusty brushes that I almost wished to just manually vacuum my place with the Dyson, where I wouldn't be so hands-on with dirt.Anyway, now that I have a Roomba 880, I'm realizing that there is a HUGE difference between the low and high end Roombas. The virtual lighthouses make a huge difference in the Roomba's ability to cover separate areas of your place reliably with every run. The unit is quieter and moves faster than the older Roombas. The rear cliff sensors give it a new ""trick"" -- reversing out of an obstacle. That seems to free itself from a chair much faster than randomly spinning-and-bumping. Of course, the improvement with the AeroForce rollers are well documented and I mostly agree -- with one exception. They seem worse on hardwood floors and other non-carpeted surfaces. The Roomba 880 had a very hard time picking up oatmeal flakes off a hardwood surface while the 595 and Botvac had no issue. Since the thread is about Botvac vs Roomba 880, I'll just talk about the advantages of each:NOISE:Roomba is quieter, by far. I can't tell if the Neato has better suction or just a louder motor.CLEANING PERFORMANCE:Roomba wins on carpet, by far. It seems to get far more dust out of the carpet than Neato does. I remember the first day I got the 880, it picked up 3 bins full of stuff, and the BotVac had been running every day.The jury is still out on hardwood, but I think the Botvac wins here. Neither is fantastic though -- both have a tendency of flinging/scattering dirt around on hardwood, and lacking the suction to pick up heavier things like oatmeal or pebbles.CLEANING SPEED:It's actually more or less a draw, which surprised me. I tested by sprinkling oatmeal (ok, I bought too much oatmeal) over the living room carpet and measuring how long it took until it was basically all picked up. It was actually around the same time.The Neato's weakness is that it first spends a lengthy amount of time circling a perimeter before zipping back and forth in quick strokes. The latter is fast, but the former acts like a drunken Roomba stumbling around with no grace (more on that later)OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE:HUGE advantage to Roomba, but specifically the 880. The Roomba 595 was not any better than the Neato BotVac, but the 880 is a TON better. My reason for buying the 880 was mainly because I usually found the Neato stuck on something. Its ""D"" shape causes it to get stuck or flung off a ground when it pinches itself under a chair leg and attempts to spin. The laser turret also leads to it getting pinched under low clearance furniture. It also catapults itself off Poang chairs, and basically gets stuck on any loose article of clothing.The Roomba is not invincible, but it gets around the house almost perfectly for a month. I've only gotten it stuck once.My torture test for this is a bathroom with 2 loose towels on the ground and a Poang chair. The Neato lasts maybe 2 minutes here before dying. The Roomba runs on average for 15 to 20 minutes, and it's almost always getting stuck on the towel that kills it. But it conquers the towel trap 19 times out of 20.Note that this is ESPECIALLY bad for Neato because it spends the first part of its cleaning cycle circling the perimeter of the room where it tends to find the most obstacles. Nothing is more disheartening than to come home to a robot that seems to have only gotten 5 minutes into its cleaning cycle.NAVIGATION:Draw. If it weren't for lighthouses, Neato would win. But ""BotVision"" has its downsides:- Once in a while it ""forgets"" to do a large chunk of your room or forgets to do a room altogether. It's rare but it happens.- Inefficient planning, ironically. It partitions rooms into 10-by-10ft squares, and cleans those squares in seemingly random order, including bouncing back and forth down a hallway between two rooms to do different parts. I call it ""showing off"". It's fun to watch but it is wasting maybe 25% of its charge in transit.- Prematurely declares areas off limits due to vision. It cannot cope with things like bed skirts and prematurely rules them out as off-limits areas. Once in a while it accidentally manages to back itself under the bedskirt and then gets ""trapped"" in there forever.- No dirt sensor makes it one-shot for bigger messes. My biggest messes tend to be popcorn crumbs near the sofa, which the Roomba(s) do an excellent job of recognizing via Dirt Detect and really getting that area clean. The Neato only knows how to make one pass across it.- Somewhat sensitive to movement / room changes. You gotta get out of the house. If you walk near it, it will avoid you like an obstacle and possibly cause it to not clean that area. If you open or close doors, or even slightly move furniture around, it can get very upset/lost.Roomba without lighthouses is pretty horrible for a large floorplan or multiple rooms. Even though you think with random walking it would eventually achieve full coverage, IT DOES NOT. There's various features (mainly obstacles and curved walls) that seem to be Roomba Black Holes and lure it into a trap. The most common one in my place is trash can -> wall hug -> dining table, spend 20 minutes bumping around the chairs.At least with a lighthouse, it knows to get out of there after covering that area once. Without lighthouses, it repeatedly gets lured into doing that instead of cleaning the rest of the place.MAINTENANCE:The Roomba wins hands down. A month into daily or twice daily usage, there's almost no wear visible on either the rollers or the spinning brush. The Neato's combo brush is pretty beat up and still has some hair clinging to it that I can't get out. The Neato's spinner is really worn and looks like a toothbrush needing to be replaced. It seems to dig that spinner deep into the carpet which frays and twists the spinner bristles itself.Even emptying the bin is way easier on the roomba. Tap the bottom against the trash can to free lint from the filter, then open the door and just dump it. The Neato requires removal of the filter which almost always results in a plume of dust being released, and the dirt clings to the filter which is really hard to remove without a vacuum. I always make a mess emptying the BotVac and getting the filter clean.AESTHETICS / OTHER:Random thoughts here:- The Roomba is infuriating to watch. Accept that it's random movement and statistically will get that crumb it missed by an inch. It's like saying you're so close to winning the lottery because your number was 1 off. It doesn't matter if it's 1 or 10 off, it's all random.- The Neato leaves a much more satisfying pattern on your carpet that says ""freshly vacuumed"". The Roomba leaves random criss cross marks and the odd circle here andÊ"

9/14/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,"Close, but not quite, the little robot that could have, but didn't have all it needed","I wish I could give it 5 stars, but there are a few shortcomings. It does a good job of sucking up dirt, but if you have pets, expect to empty it often. I recommend every time you stop it. It is nice to have the Roomba doing the work, but it is not as slick as the movies make it seem.First, for the price, this is the most expensive of the models, and yet it only comes with two light houses. That third light house really makes a difference when trying to keep Roomba in one place.Second, Roomba can't seem to make a distinction between a light house and it's home base. Telling it to dock is difficult unless the light houses are picked up, and Roomba is close (but not too close) to the base.Third, there are no clear instructions on how to use Roomba with respect to cleaning the house. The thing seems to have the capacity to clean an entire house, but doesn't seem to have the smarts for doing it. The unit has no concept of a room, and does not seem to have much learning ability. If you want to clean one room, and you leave the doors closed, all is well. If you want to clean the whole house, no way will that happen on any kind of automated schedule.fourth, for all the tech in Roomba, no wifi, no z-wave, no zigbee, just one finicky infra red remote.iRobot, if you are here reading, pay attention. This unit has too few smarts, too little memory, and to little integration.Fifth, Roomba mostly just wanders around, even after repeated cleanings. It learns a little about a room it is based in, but that seems to be it.Sixth, wires and cables are not handled well. If you leave your iPhone charger cable dangling, Roomba is doomed. Larger cables, like power cords, don't get tangled, but Roomba has difficulty negotiating the cords.Lastly, rugs are not Roomba-friendly unless they are very thin. Nothing with shag. Nothing too soft. Ikea bath mats are not good with Roomba.I could go on, but just know this: your house needs to be very tidy, very open, with legged furniture, and noting larger than an M&M on the floor for Roomb to be effective. Put your chairs up on the table, and don't try for too much area at any one time."
02/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Roomba 880 vs. Golden Retriever,"I will start off by saying I have a 85 lbs. Golden Retriever and a medium hair cat.Ê Anyone that has a Golden Retriever knows the level of fur that drops is amazing.Ê I have a Dyson Animal that handles it all, and requires the brushes to have the fur removed from the brush about once per year.Ê Overall, it chews through it and does an amazing job with almost no maintenance.The Roomba 880 does an excellent job cleaning our hard travertine floor.Ê It's made a significant impact in the fur and dirt in our hard floored rooms. However, on heavier nap carpet, it gets stuck, beeps, and shuts off.Ê So much for being multi-surface.Ê I'm sure it would be fine on short carpet.Another major downfall of the Roomba is that the waste bin fills up after every cycle.Ê It fills up after vacuuming a 500 SF room on a daily basis.Ê This is disappointing.Ê This means that there is really no point in me setting it up to run automatically, as I have to empty the bin daily for it to run well. (I am mindful that it's mostly dog hair, but it's still a chore).Ê Once or twice per week, I have to pull the brushes out of the unit to remove tangled up fur.Ê The good news is that iRobot made this maintenance very easy.Ê They engineered the brushes themselves, and the mechanism that holds them very well.Ê I can remove them in seconds.About once per month, I have to remove the rotating side brush with a screwdriver and take fur out of that.Bottom line: The Roomba 880 does a good job keeping my hard floor fur-free.Ê However, it requires a LOT of tending to if you have a heavy shedding pet.I look forward to seeing if Dyson manages to make a solid Robot this year."
5/21/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Better than Expected,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this vacuum, but after a months of nearly daily use I can say I am impressed.My first thought was it wouldn't clean near edges, or get confused by table legs and such, but after watching it for several hours (I am an easily entertained engineer) I am impressed.Cleaning:I vacuumed my floor immediately before I set the Roomba free, and was disgusted at how much hair and grit it dug out of the carpet.Ê It doesn't have much suction power, but the little rollers do their job at picking stuff up.Ê There was a lot of cat hair that had probably been there for 2 or 3 years.Ê First room filled the trash bit, but each consecutive use reduces the amount somewhat so after a while it will do more than one room without emptying the bin.Ê The small brush pulls debris from near edges in front of the rollers so it can clean by walls.Ê Hard floors it works okay, it picks up most of the loose debris, but obviously need to wet mop or something (Scooba) to get anything stuck to the floor.Algorithms:It does a good job cleaning the entire floor.Ê Sometimes it will miss small areas, but if you are smart with the virtual walls (2 included) it will help the vacuum out a lot.Ê If the vacuum becomes hung up on say a carpet square running over some speaker wires in a wire protector, it does a good job of lifting itself up and working itself free.Ê It has no problems transitioning from hard to carpet in my house and even does fine with the standing mats/welcome mats in the kitchen and by the doors.Ê I haven't seen them look that clean.Ê Ever.The Roomba is slow, much slower than vacuuming by hand, but at the same time you can prep a room and set it free while you go do something else.Ê You can also schedule the Roomba to run when you want, although with kids in the house I prefer to clean up all their toys and hit start.It seems it won't fall off steps, stops well before it gets off balance and goes over the edge.Battery:It will run for quite a while, maybe enough to do 2 or 3 small rooms.Maintenance:Make sure you dump the catch container every run, and also regularly pull out the rubber rollers and make sure there is no hair tangled up in them.Ê If you see the flashing magnifying glass icon, it means you need to take the rollers out I believe, the book really isn't very clear on that.Ê If it is illuminated steady it is doing a spot cleaning of a certain area which is a bit different.Ê Or maybe dirty rollers confuse it into doing a spot cleaning, not entirely certain, but taking the rollers out and a quick clean of the compartment made the notification go away.Virtual Walls and Light Houses:Set the virtual wall(s) to prevent the Roomba from wandering into other rooms, certain areas might prevent it from cleaning well.Ê Use the light house mode to prevent it from crossing that area until it has finished the area it is in.Ê This is useful for a large room you want to divide into smaller regions.Ê Maybe if it has a complex arrangement or something that would confuse the Roomba.Ê These beacons turn on automatically when the Roomba is running and go to sleep when it is not.Bottom Line:I really like the Roomba, and haven't used the traditional vacuum since we got it.Ê My wife has grown to like it too, and even my daughter loves following it around.Ê She usually interferes with its cleaning pattern though by sitting in front of it and laughing as it tries to clean around her."
01/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I was amazed and very impressed,"I was very skeptical at with the first trial run. I was amazed and very impressed. It did a better job than I ever could. Recommend it over humans. I have named it Robby.Buy it especially if u have pets , kids or a lazy spouse."
06/02/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Beyond my Expectations,"I was very skeptical about a robot that could clean my condo. I bought it as a toy, but I praise it as a useful tool. I set it to clean my 1100 square foot apartment at 10am every day. When I come home it is nestled back in it's dock and it is filled with dust bunnies and dirt. After 10 days my allergies have subsided, and my apartment is much cleaner. I hate cleaning. This device is a godsend. It is not perfect. It occasionally gets stuck under my sofa. But, I would never ever clean under my sofa, so the 2 times a week it gets stuck is worth the aggravation. Great product. Well done!"
01/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I'm in love!,"I was very sceptical with this but decided to give it a try. And I love it! Not sure how much time I'm saving since I keep watching it go around and around... It's like staring into the fire... Such a fun little bugger! It is easy to use, it does a great job and while it's vacuuming, I can do the dusting or whatever. Now I need to get the one to do the lawn!!!Update: About a month later and our love has just grown stronger! I've been using it almost daily at different parts of the house and it is amazing! I don't have to vacuum anymore! My house is cleaner because Roomba is cleaning it more often than I ever did. And more thoroughly than I ever did. It definitely goes with me to the desert island!"
11/29/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,It is fantastic.. We love it,I was truly skeptical.Ê It is fantastic.. We love it.Ê Amazing how much dirt it picks up in places you did not reach.. (under beds)... we have a large home and it does take a day or two to figure out how to break up the house to do it all.. but - it is work it.. Amazing - love it..
05/06/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Skeptic to Believer to Depender,"I was skeptical...really, really skeptical about these robot vacuums.Ê After seeing them at Costco I still waited years to even consider one.Ê Well recent back problems suddenly made a robot vacuum something that now makes sense, IF it worked.Ê After researching manufacture's sites and reading pages and pages of reviews I settled on buying the Roomba 880 (aka 'Hal').Ê Yes it's expensive, but the new improvements in the 800 series really work well for me.I live in a 3 bedroom 2 bath house (1400 SF) that has hard floors, area and throw rugs, rubber/foam kitchen mats, low pile and deep pile carpets.Ê After I experimented with how the Roomba works, how much it can clean in a given ""session"", how it uses Virtual Lighthouse (room nodes) and Virtual Fences (and a Virtual Wall Halo for pet food bowls) and docking stations, I now have a setup that works extremely well for me that I will describe below.Ê NOTE:Ê The entire setup is not cheap when you add all the parts up, BUT it does exactly what I want which is to vacuum my entire house for me, something that has become very challenging to do due to chronic back problems:Setup Items:I purchased the higher capacity Lithium battery for the Roomba to both extend battery life and overall run time.Ê This is the one I bought:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FML2LYK/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1The Roomba 880 comes with 2 Lighthouse Virtual Wall units and one Docking Station/Charger.Ê I added 3 more Lighthouse units, a Virtual Wall Halo (for pet food bowls) and a second Docking Station/Charger.I also purchased enough rechargeable ""C"" cell batteries to keep the above units happy.Scenario and Results:With the above accessories my Roomba 880 vacuums 1/2 of my house every other day and it does a better job than I ever did using my Dyson, partially due to the frequency that I would vacuum, but I think this is mainly due to how thorough the Roomba is AND how well it vacuums up pet hair and dust/dirt.Ê The overall dust level is significantly lower (much less dust on furniture) now that I am using the Roomba 880.Ê Everyday it picks up an amazing amount of pet hair, cat litter, dust and dirt.Ê I honestly think it is a ""cleaner"" vacuum than my Dyson Animal by both removing dust (as my Dyson also did) but also containing dust in it's filtering system as it vacuums.Ê My Dyson Animal DC07 is a great vacuum but it has always stirred up a lot of dust as it cleans since the exhaust port blows down onto the floor/carpet as it vacuums, the Roomba does not and the HEPA filter is easily cleaned after each vacuuming when you empty the bin .One BIG feature of the new 800 series is the ribbed extractors instead of conventional brush rollers that are supposed to greatly reduce how often you clean hair from them.Ê After a couple months of daily use with bins full of super fine, long pet hair, I have never had to remove any hair (or anything) from the new rubber ribbed extractor rollers.Ê The ONLY maintenance has been to empty the dirt bin each day and tap out the bin filter, very easy to do and eye opening each time to see how much Roomba picks up each day.At first the ""random"" nature of it's navigation routine was captivating to watch as I wondered how in the world it could clean well using that ""logic"", but it does clean really, really well.Ê It's also hard not to ""watch"" the darn thing when you first start using it as you try to figure out the advertised 60 robotic logic routines it uses in the iAdapt system.Ê All I know is my house has never been cleaner and both myself and my pets are a lot happier with clean, super clean floors.NOTE on making a house Roomba friendly:These newer 800 series seem to do really well at not getting hung up on cords and things.Ê I have LOTS of network, power, audio, computer, cords and I haven't had to remove an eaten cord yet. Likewise with throw rugs and rubber mat corners, if Roomba hits some rugs/mats diagonally it can begin to fold them back, but even if they get turned up and/or sucked into the ribbed extractors, the Roomba is great at spitting them back out, spinning around and continuing on it's task.Ê This 880 is tenacious about getting un-stuck BUT it will get stuck given the right conditions.Ê For my situation, I simply watched the Roomba over several sessions around my house and fixed a few issues I had to where the 880 no longer needs watching, it just works.Using two docking stations:I am using automatic scheduled cleanings that happen each day, where the 880 wakes up based on the time of day I set to begin vacumming.Ê After each vacuuming I simply empty the dirt/dust bin and clean the HEPA filter and put the 880 into alternate docking stations, every other day, located at opposite ends of the house.Ê I am using one of the Lighthouse units as a ""Fence"", that divides my house into two halves, with one docking station located in each half.Ê I did not need to purchase the second docking station to clean my house effectively, but it is much more convenient since Roomba automatically docks itself after each cleaning session for charging and having a station in each end of the house allows the Roomba to dock and charge no matter which half it has just cleaned.Ê Now my ONLY task is to empty the bin and put Roomba in the docking station that is located in the half of the house I want vacuumed the next day.Room Nodes: Virtual Lighthouse Room ModeI highly recommend using the Virtual Lighthouse Room Nodes that tell the Roomba where individual rooms are.Ê The idea is that containing the Roobma to smaller areas allows more efficient cleaning and that is definitely the case.Ê When using the Lighthouse units in room mode, the 880 finishes each room before continuing into the next.Ê They work great and I think they are critical to getting the best experience from your Roomba.Ê You don't necessarily need a Lighthouse at every single room with a door, but locating them at doorways into main rooms allows the Roomba to work as intended.Ê I have a large master bedroom, with small hallway walkthrough closet that leads to the master bathroom (creates an 'L' shape room) that the Roomba does well, but I also have a living room and kitchen floor plan that also makes a much larger 'L' shape that I ended up needing a Lighthouse in room mode to separate the kitchen into it's own room to allow the 880 to clean efficiently.I started off a huge skeptic and I now truly appreciate and depend on ""Hal"" to do my vacuuming everyday, rain or shine.Ê OH, on a skittish pet note...I have a cat who is normally timid and scared of new things and she could care less about ""Hal"" and I absolutely know she's a lot happier to not be living in all that dirt, dust and hair ""Hal"" kindly removes everyday :)"
11/27/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Works great!,"I was skeptical, now I just empty the bin everyday."
7/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,and this thing is excellent!,"I was skeptical, but my wife wanted it, so I bought it for her.Ê We have two cats, and hardwood floors with rugs, and this thing is excellent!"
11/30/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,"Frees up your time, cleans well, but requires a lot of hand-holding.","I was skeptical when I bought the Roomba.Ê Our vacuum needed to be replaced and I figured I could try this out and return it if I didn't like it.Ê First run performance was astounding.Ê It really cleaned the floor VERY well.Ê Even in the corners.Ê Wasn't too loud either (as other reviews had mentioned).Ê Sure it makes noise, but it's about half as loud as any vacuum I've ever heard.All-in-all, I'm not completely amazed by this device; although it shines in many ways, its shortcomings are starting to get on my nerves.Ê Below is a break-down of the pros and cons I've experienced.Ê Hopefully this will help you make an informed decision:PROS:o - Cleans well.There's no denying it.Ê This vacuum does a great job, especially in corners.Ê If I leave it in a room and press start, when I come back, the floor is super clean and I was able to focus my time and energy on something more important.o - Anti-tangle feature rocks.Got power cords, chargers, or other wires/cables on the floor?Ê Don't worry.Ê The Roomba senses these items and never gets tangled in them.Ê I was worried about this, but the roomba can go pretty much anywhere without causing a problem.o - Scheduler - ISet this thing to start up around 10:45am daily when no one's home.Ê You can schedule one time for each day of the week.Ê I come home and the place is spotless.Ê AWESOME!!!o - Move it where you need it and leave it alone.I originally thought you had to use the roomba in just one place thinking it would have to ""learn"" the configuration of the room.Ê That's not the case.Ê Just pick the Roomba up and move it to where you need it and hit 'Clean' and walk away.Ê It does all the work.Ê When you come back into that room, it's totally clean.Ê I LOVE this.o - Spot Clean is really niceYou can put the roomba in the middle of a very messy area and hit ""spot"" and it will do this spiral clean job covering about a 3 foot diameter circle area and cleans it up.o - Remote controlOnce you figure it out (see complaints below), the remote is very very handy.Ê You can get it to clean small jobs right where you want it to.o - Emptying is quick and easyI used to have a dyson and emptying it usually got lots of dust everywhere.Ê The Roomba is much easier to handle and empty.Ê Also, the filters (comes with two) are easy to clean.Ê I usually rinse it off with warm water and let it dry while the other one is in the roomba.Ê I always have a clean filter around.Ê The manufacturer may want me to buy replacements, but this method works very very well for me.Ê I never put a wet or damp filter into the vacuum.o - Doesn't fall down stairs.Ê Totally stops at the edge of the stairs.o - gentle on furnitureThe roomba senses walls and other furniture that comes all the way to the floor (like chest of drawers).Ê It will slow down to a very slow speed when it approaches these items and doesn't nick or damage the furniture.Ê for chair legs, it does bump though.Ê The edge of the device is cushioned though so it's very gentle.o - When it works, it really works well.Ê But it's not perfect.Ê Read cons below.CONS:o - Doesn't always pick up fine fibersWe got one of those over-sized fake spiders for halloween.Ê The darned thing shed these clumps of black microfibers from its hairy legs.Ê The roomba 880 went over these many times and never picked them up.Ê This is when the bristle brush model would have probably done a superior job compared to the silicon rollers.Ê Finally, I used a Shark vacuum (like a dustbuster with a beater bar in it).Ê That got the hairs up.o - Chairs and obstacles extend the cleaning timeNavigating the dining room table and chair legs is an arduous task for the roomba.Ê It WILL clean well in all of these areas, but it can take a VERY long time bumping, turning moving, bumping, turning, moving over and over again often getting ""trapped"" between the legs of the same chair more than once.o - Owners manual is a jokeI work in the technology field and get paid to figure out how complex systems function.Ê This owners manual gave practically ZERO helpful information.Ê I had to scour the internet to figure out how the virtual wall and virtual lighthouse (failed to) work.Ê Doesn't tell you the best place to position your roomba dock.Ê Doesn't tell you how the lighthouse works.Ê Doesn't tell you how the wall works.Ê Doesn't tell you how the remote control (REALLY) works.o - Remote control is ridiculously confusingYou can use the remote to ""wake up the roomba"" by pressing the 'clean' button.Ê Then you are supposed to be able to move it to a spot you want it to start cleaning in by using the direction buttons on the remote.Ê However, as soon as your finger leaves one of these buttons, the roomba goes into ""dock"" mode and starts looking for its home.Ê It took me a while to figure out that you had to press the 'clean' button again to get it to stop looking for the dock, the press it once more to have it start to clean.Ê Really confusing and this is NOT what the manual says it should do.o - Frequently cannot find its dockThis happens probably 50% of the time.Ê I come home and the roomba isn't in its dock.Ê I hunt around and eventually find it sitting in some lonely corner just as dead as a doornail.Ê This is not supposed to happen, especially when the roomba has woken up on its own and starting a cleaning cycle.Ê One would imagine the ""intelligent"" device would remember where its dock was positioned, but this is not the case.Ê Lovely bonus... we left for Thanksgiving vacation and I set the scheduler and left.Ê Came home and the roomba was in the living room dead.Ê The memory had been lost for the time of day and day of the week, which I had to reset.Ê The schedule stayed in memory, but the clock... nope.Ê The kitchen wasn't ever cleaned so I came home to a dirty house.Ê Something that a $700 vacuum should do, no??o - Needs to be emptied frequently.At least daily.Ê If not, more.Ê We moved into a place with some new carpet.Ê If you've ever gotten new carpet, you'll know that it sheds a lot of fiber in the first few months of ownership.Ê Due to this factor, the Roomba would fill up its dirt bay within about 5 minutes of running.Ê Now, it's a little better.Ê This is purely a function of the carpet and with older carpets, it doesn't have this problem.o - ""Algorithm"" ain't all that smartI thought this robot would ""learn"" the lay of the land and get the floor cleaned in the most efficient manner possible.Ê This couldn't be further from the truth.Ê As we all know, every room has... you know... furniture.Ê If you had a completely empty rectangular room, the Roomba would clean it pretty systematically, I'm sure.Ê But once it bumps into a table leg or lamp base or whatever, it just goes off in a new direction.Ê I've personally witnessed the Roomba spend over an hour and a half (not exaggerating) in a 16x16 square foot room seemingly going over the same areas several times.o - Virtual Lighthouse is uselessThe virtual lighthouse is a black device that's about the size of your fist that is supposed to cast an infra-red beam across a doorway separating two rooms and act as a temporary barrier between these rooms. The idea is that only when the roomba is done cleaning the first room, it will cross the barrier and start to clean the other room.Ê This model comes with 2 of these devices, but I've never seen the roomba successfully clean three rooms.Ê Partly because it gets full too fast, and partly because once it crosses that first barrier, it doesn't really know the difference between the first and the second.Ê Eventually, it just thinks it's completely done and goes into 'dock' mode.Ê But in these cases, it won't cross back over the invisible barrier to get to the room where its dock is.Ê One usually ends up turning the roomba off manually, or it just shuts itself off.o - Virtual wall is okay, but if the Roomba was a little smarter, you wouldn't even need it.Ê The virtual wall is the same device as the lighthouse.Ê You just flip a switch on it to become a wall.Ê This is just like the lighthouse only the barrier becomes ""permanent"".Ê If you didn't have this, the roomba would take hours to clean one floor as it randomly bounced around tryin"
06/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Yes, it's *that* good...","I was skeptical of the merits of spending so much on what I fear would prove to be a novelty or toy, but after letting Roomba do its thing for the past few days, I'm thrilled.It's not quite a ""set and forget"" device (it's stalled out once on a cord and wedged itself under a cabinet once). The battery life is limited (enough for two big carpeted rooms but not a lot more). The bin fills up quickly (partly because it gets more dirt than my fancy upright vac, but also because the bin is just physically small).But mostly, it's a huge time-saver, does a better job than I would do, and it's amusing to have around. Five stars. Great purchase."
06/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,... skeptical at first about purchasing a Roomba but so glad I did,"I was skeptical at first about purchasing a Roomba but so glad I did! This machine is Awesome! I followed the quick start menu and was off and cleaning. I couldn't believe the amount of dirt it picked up on the first cleaning. Before I purchased the Roomba I was using my $1500.00 Kirby.The best thing about this device, it does all the work for you!"
12/03/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,This thing is amazing..,"I was skeptic about these types of vacuums, but decided to finally pull the trigger.Ê I've only had this Roomba for a few weeks, but I have quickly become obsessed with it.Ê This thing is amazing...and so far, worth every penny.Ê I have mostly hardwoods in my house and tile in the kitchen, as well as an 85lb dog who sheds like there is no tomorrow.Ê He may not love the Roomba, but I sure do.Ê I run it nearly every day and am amazed at how well it does with picking up fur balls, dust, dirt, etc.Ê Yes, it gets hung up on shag area rugs sometimes and once in a while needs to be moved, but all in all, this thing is brilliant.Ê Best part, it goes underneath chairs, couches, tables, armories, etc., where most people don't clean regularly.Ê If you hate vacuuming (like I do), buy this iRobot and let it do the work for you.Ê This thing is SMART and I'm regretting not having bought one years ago.Ê BUY this vacuum!"
5/13/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Pricey but well worth it,"I was quite hesitant to buy this item but read every review I could find to be informed.Ê I used another Roomba for the first time recently and I was impressed.Ê We have two cats, one of which has long hair, so I decided after all my reading to get this model. I bought it at a place where I had a 20% off coupon.Ê I charged the battery overnight, used it for the first time today and I am thrilled with this product!Ê It has picked up two bins full of cat hair from a carpet that looked clean.Ê It gets right up to the baseboards in the kitchen and goes under some of the furniture.Ê I have not yet taken it upstairs to clean under the beds, but, I think those areas, and the rest of our home are going to be a lot cleaner than they have been before.Ê It really was a major purchase, but I am very glad I made that choice."
06/12/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I love this Vacuum,"I was not sure if it would actually be able to handle my home, but it has done a great job.Ê I have 8 cats and one dog so I was vacuuming every day and still missed spots, or the hair would move around while I vacuumed and wouldn't see it until I had put the vacuum away.Ê GGRRRRRÊ This little thing comes on at 3 pm everyday and does a better job at it, then I did.Ê It has only got stuck once because it got under a piece of furniture that is higher in the front then in the back or sides.Ê I still vacuum with the regular vacuum once a week to get in the areas that are to small for him to be able to get in, but my life is so much easier with this little thing/him."
12/26/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Love!,I was hesitant to buy a Roomba even though I've wanted one for years. I love this little guy. I bought this one at Target and it was about $150 more than the other model. The battery lasts longer and it said it can do multiple rooms.It's a great little machine. We had to empty it twice on day one. I had no idea that my oreck was that bad. We charged it up and brought it upstairs today.

05/07/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Really works!,I was hesitant at first when trying to decide if I should buy this expensive little gadget.Ê After all how could this little unit really do the job. I'm happy to say it really works. Everytime I let it loose it comes up with a full dirt cup and it leaves me wondering where all the dirt comes from when I can't see any. It has made a monotonous chore fun.

03/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Wow - This Really Works!,"I was a little hesitant to order a robot vacuum; I've always thought they were a gimmick that would fade into the sunset once they had their day. But then my sister-in-law talked me into getting one, and I'm in love! To be able to sit here and surf the net or do something else while Minnie cleans my wood floors (I hate cleaning floors!) - what's not to love?!? And clean it, she does!I do have to purchase another lighthouse or two - but I have about 2,000 sq ft of ""odd"" living space - angled rooms, etc. For someone with squared-off spaces, I don't see where this would be necessary.She's expensive, yes, but my time is more important to me than doing housework, so this is worth every penny!General ""good to know"" info:- I clean out the dirt bin after every cleaning. We have three pets (short hair), so I just do it whether it needs it or not.- I have very long hair, and so even though Minnie does a good job of vacuuming things up and not getting wrapped around the rubber rollers, the hair will get caught up in 1) the wheel compartment that holds the rubber rollers in place, and 2) the little ""sweeper side brush"" will also get long hair caught around the spinning wheel up inside of it - so you will need to clean that out maybe once a week or so depending on how often you vacuum. For the little side brush, you just take a small screwdriver, unscrew it, clean the hair out of the wheel, and screw it back in.Honestly it sounds like more work and effort than it is. I was annoyed when my SIL told me and showed me how to do it, but after she showed me, I was like ""okay, that's really no big deal at all, and still totally worth every penny!""Cheers!"
09/12/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was a hesitant. Could this really do the job or was it an overhyped, overpriced, underperforming tech gadget? My home has 2600 sq ft of bamboo and tile floor with only small area rugs in two of the rooms. Dust and dirt can be quite visible on hard surface floors, but at least you know that it's there. And for this purpose Roomba seems most ideal. It is easy to setup and use. I thought my floors were fairly clean the first time I used it and was astounded at the amount of dirt that filled the collection bin. A few observations: It cleans extremely well, but not perfectly. There will be a few areas it just can't reach and you will need to do some touchup cleaning on occasion. The collection bin and filter need to emptied / cleaned far more frequently that a full-sized vacuum, but it's an easy task. It's not significantly louder than my other vacuums (a Miela canister and Sebo upright, both of which I consider fairly quiet). I have not had any problems with wire or furniture entanglement. In fact, it slides right under most of my furniture, where dust bunnies hide. It seems to be well designed and built. Is it worth the price? For me, yes. For others, I can't say. But if you have hard flooring, are a bit OCD about keeping it clean and like the idea of letting a robot do the work, Roomba may be for you."
4/24/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,A Great Helper --Remember the Consumables,"I was a fairly early adopter of robot vacuum cleaners, having had a Neato XV-11 in the house for nearly 3 years. And it's been useful, if temperamental, and requiring a lot of care and frequent untangling from bits of string. And now, in comes this refined next generation robot cleaner and I am just blown away with how advanced it is.First of all, it gets jammed less. Not that it can't get jammed or caught. This allows a lot more autonomous use, and makes possible the promise of scheduled cleaning. With my old vacuum, I'd have never dared use its timer function (even if its clock could be made to keep the time after a full battery discharge) as I'd most surely have come home to a beeping, helpless robot with a shoelace wrapped around its brush. With this Roomba, there is a good probability it will be able to clean up my front room and get back to its dock without intervention. As I have children likely to leave large scale debris everywhere, I've gotten into the habit of picking up the Roomba's room every morning while getting them off to school and allowing the Roomba to complete its schedule later in the day when nobody is there. Then later on, if I have the time, I'll make sure the kitchen area is clear and move it there for a second chore of the day.It will occasionally collect long bits of hair which end up coiled around the tips of the 'extractors' but these are easily removed; I'm sure you could remove any coiled hair in 10 seconds if you were in a hurry. Hair can also manage to coil itself around and under the auxiliary side brush fouling it and causing it to stop, if it stops in the right place it can even block the ledge sensor on that corner of the robot and allow it to drive over the lip of a step or other drop off. Luckily, the brush is easily removed with a screwdriver and disentangle it in a few seconds. iRobot technical support was able to suggest this fix via online chat after a 12 minute wait for a human.Originally, I had a small shag area rugÊ in the Roomba's room, but I've since moved it because not only did the robot struggle getting around on even that small area, but it was picking up long nylon fibers that were actively cutting into the rubber extractors on the bottom and wearing them out faster than it would otherwise. That cheap pink rug, was this guy's arch enemy. On hard wood and flat carpets it breezes along. And it does a lot of cleaning on a charge. It easily cleans my entire top floor on a charge (perhaps 900 square feet). Listen for any change in its noise, if it's picked up something large (like for instance a small zip-lock bag) that needs to be manually removed you can definitely hear a change in pitch.The tower, virtual wall system works OK, although it's a bit hard to find a place for the virtual wall near my doorway.I have a hard time believing they expect people will follow the proscribed maintenance of wiping it down every week. We'll see. My extractors are already getting a bit worn on the ends after a month of erratic use, I can see why they'll have to be replaced a couple times a year; yet I don't see them sold here on Amazon, only on the iRobot website for now.It certainly picks up more and a larger variety of debris than my old Neato, all the while being noticeably less noisy. Also, it's a bit shorter so it can go under a bench in my TV room that the Neato couldn't.The glossy upper shell tends to pick up scratches if you flip it over to access the bottom; what a shame. So take care, or don't let it bother you.Controls are large, the display is bright and clear. The instruction manual is a well laid out and clear, although the lawyers did make them add a lot of ridiculous safety warnings. I'm not sure about the utility of the remote control. It's cool, but in real life, I think only the handicapped will find it useful.The device has 3 parts that are consumed in normal operation, the filter which is about $8 a piece, the roller set which is about $30 and the spinning brush which is about $5, My rollers are getting quite beat up, but I'm not sure when they'll cross the line and need replacing. I can't find anyplace but iRobot's own website to get the roller set, so add in shipping costs too.In general, I've been extremely pleased with the robot and it has motivated me to keep my front room tidy every day. Which is miraculous."
12/31/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,absolutely the best,"I was a bit skeptical about how effective this would be with a large shedding dog and a small shedding long haired cat....a friend raved about hers so Santa brought me one. One word: Wow.Ê Not only does this machine do a great job on multiple rooms, and multiple floor types--wood, tile, carpet--it does it quickly. After the initial vacuuming, it became faster and more efficient. I still have to dump the bin about every 20 minutes, but the time and effort that it saves me on daily vacuuming is wonderful!Ê I have a few furniture items that it can't get under or gets stuck, but I think I can use the little blocker beacon to stop that. I thought it was sooo expensive, but now, if anything ever happens to this one--we've even named her--I'm definitely getting another one. Isn't technology wonderful!"

08/07/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I love this thing.,"I think the closest thing I would compare this too is a dishwasher, especially considering some people's objections to it (and the price!). My dishwasher takes over two hours. If I do the dishes by hand I can probably have them done in less than a quarter of that time. Plus, it doesn't eliminate all my dish-washing work: I still have to rinse, load, and unload. If dishwashers were new and you just bought your first, you may complain about those issues. I, however, love my dishwasher and would loose my mind if I had to go back to hand-washing dishes.I also love my Roomba. It takes forever and I have to do a bit of prep work first (pick up clutter and maybe put some dinning room chairs up), but that takes about 1 minute and then you can just press the button and move on to other things. And it really does a very good job. Better than any upright I've ever owned. Mostly, I think, because it ends up going over most spots many, many times by the time it's done. When I vacuum myself, I go over each strip of floor once (maybe) at about 100 miles an hour in an effort to get it over with. I kept my Dyson upright for a couple weeks, but I really have no use for it now. I'm still keeping a small stick vacuum around for the stairs and quick cleanups, but that's it."
12/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Vacuums like a seven year old with mild OCD and ADHD.,I think it's nice to have a robot vacuum my carpet and bare floors every day. It picks up pet hair too! I need to get a second for the lower level of the house though.

05/12/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Worth every dollar,"I suppose you could say I was slightly more than hesitant to buy a robotic vacuum - especially when it costs more than my old Dyson D14 Animal did years ago.However, in our 1800 square foot house with 2 shorthair dogs, hardwood floors, tile, and a couple of area rugs, we have a massive hair problem; and that's with cleaning the floors once per week and bathing and grooming the dogs on a regular basis. So you could say the wife and I took a leap of faith and bought this 880 model. With being able to set it to clean once per day, we figured that even if it didn't do as good of a job as my Dyson, that at least it would help with our weekly cleaning.Our first use of the 880 came just 3 days after we cleaned the floors. As anyone with hardwood floors can testify, you can certainly pick-up a lot of dirt and hair without the floors ever really looking dirty, and that was most definitely the case here. Before the unit was done with the house, we had to empty the dust bin twice. Watching the unit work is interesting as well. You almost want to guide it around (and you can with the included remote control) because it almost looks as if it's not going to clean the whole area, but it eventually does. It effortlessly hopped over some speaker wire channel that I have laid-down on the floor that's about half an inch tall to clean behind the couch, and I wasn't expecting it to do that at all. We have since set it to clean daily to prevent it from filling up the bin completely, and have been able to skip using the Dyson at all while mopping/waxing the floors now.The only time I've seen it get stuck was when it went into the master bathroom and tried to go between the toilet and the wall. When it started to back-up after realizing it couldn't make it, it started to suck-up the thick mat surrounding the toilet - but it handled the mats in the guest bathroom like a champ, so perhaps it was just a fluke. Regardless, it can happen.As far as it bumping into objects, it's quite gentle. We have a glass display table by our front door with objects that would break if they were bumped too hard. As you watch the unit run towards an object, its proximity detection slows down the forward motion, causing a rather gentle nudge instead of a full-force bump, and it handled the table with ease.The bottom line, at least as far as I'm concerned, is buy this model - especially if you have any circumstances similar to mine. While sure, it might not clean as well as the latest and greatest Dyson made for hardwood floors (which I certainly wouldn't buy now because of this), but it still cleans well, plus you're paying for the convenience of having it do the work for you - and it'll go places your regular vacuum won't."
2/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Five Stars,I should have it long time ago
6/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,but it cleans as good as anything else I've used,"I run my 88 several times a week in different areas of the house.Ê For the life of me I can't understand how is tracks to cover the entire room/area, but it cleans as good as anything else I've used.Ê I'm very satisfied with its performance.Ê There is a technique of sorts that you pick up on as you become more familiar with operation ofÊ the Roomba.Ê The jury is still out durability, but that not withstanding, I'm very pleased with the Roomba."
5/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Best Robot for My House,"I researched the Roomba 870-880, the Neato 85 and the Iclebo Arte. The Roomba (880) is clearly the best for my situation. I have oak wood floors with a darkish stain, and 3 Persian carpets with 1-3"" fringe, one of which is also a very thin flat weave that can not be cleaned with a stand up vacuum without taking PIA precautions to prevent it from being sucked up. It represents the worst case scenario for an oriental throw rug. My Roomba ""Max"" handles all this beautifully and I believe is the only Robot that can do so and still give a deep vacuum clean. If you have a similar situation the Roomba aeroforce series is a no brainer. Below I will list the key positives first, and then will discuss the single annoying flaw of this Roomba series.Pros:1) The crazy ""random"" vacuum pattern is NOT crazy. So called consumer testers love to throw down dirt and measure how much gets cleaned by each robot in one pass. Most comment that the Roomba 880 takes the longest to clean, misses some spots, and bounces around randomly. The whole assessment based on a single cleaning is irrelevant. These robots clean painlessly multiple times each week. The important point is how well does it clean over an extended period. Good luck finding such a review!Ê I do not believe the so called random pattern has no intelligence to it, I think it records its bouncing about and makes adjustments to move to missed spots. Not one of these testers has any access to the Roomba algorithm and none should be concluding its pattern is random. Secondly, while the crisscrossing patterns the Roomba uses does take longer to clean a room it does a better job. That is because each crisscross represents a double cleaning of that area and those crisscrosses seem more concentrated in the open areas where people walk. So this ""randomness"" is more intelligent than it has been given credit by the professional critics.2) The Roomba does focused cleaning on problem areas. Just like a human, Roomba has a dirt detection system and will concentrate on areas where it senses dirt. Also, it is great alongside walls where dust collects, and the Roomba makes short stuttering twisting back and forth movements as it chugs along the wall. This is not ""random"", but rather unrecognized genius.3) Intelligent obstacle management. My house is tough with chairs, floor cords, and fringed carpets everywhere. The Roomba handles most all of it. It has been brilliant on carpet fringe up to 3"" long. It detects it and spits it out. After a week it has not got hung up once on the fringe. Likewise it generally does not get stuck on my cables. However, these do slow it down and I have taken to cleaning them up to minimizes that bitt. The circular shape of the Roomba should outperform its D-shaped competitor by not getting stuck in tight areas, like under chair legs, because it simply rotates and redirects itself to escape. At the end of the day the Roomba requires less adjustments to my room than other robots (the Iclebo may be an exception but does not have a powerful vacuum and is an therefore non-starter for me).4) The Roomba reduces allergen exposure. Some say this is not true but they are coming from thinking about air purifiers. Clearly the Roomba and Neato in particular are going to be very helpful, because the HEPA filters are going to allow the high concentration of dirt on the floor to be picked up without spewing it into the air. It is about removing the reservoir of allergens in your house, rather than removing allergens already in your air. This is a great device for allergy sufferers such as myself.5) Do not get distracted by dust bin size. The strength of the vacuum and the size of the HEPA filter are more important. Once you do the initial cleanings the Roomba dust bin is plenty big enough for its intended maintenance function. It keeps your house clean by frequently vacuuming effortlessly. It is not intended to clean massive messes. If the local football team visits after the game and does not wipe their feet, get out your upright. Use the right tool for the job. For the Roomba I would highly encourage getting a routine together to clean the HEPA filter. I use a compressor to blow it out from inside to the outside. Most won't have that option but perhaps can use a strong hand vac. One must keep these small filters clean regardless of the robot. That is the main chore you assume relative to a traditional vacuum.6) The double rubber roller cleaners are brilliant and do not collect hair and threads that need to be constantly cleaned out. Say goodbye to that disgusting chore.Cons:1) Their is little doubt that future models will incorporate some sort of GPS based easy to program room navigation. In the meantime we have the ""Lighthouse"" for the Roomba. Its function is poorly described in the manual. Dawn, who writes the top Amazon review on this model, gives a great description worth the read. Here is my description of the way to understand and use it productively:Lighthouse mode DOES NOT function as the name implies. It DOES NOT attractÊ the Roomba into a designated room, like a ship to a harbor. Instead it acts the same as a Virtual Wall, but once the Roomba finishes cleaning that walled in area, it is allowed out to begin cleaning the adjacent room. Perhaps ""Lighthouse Mode"" should have been called Virtual Gate. This ""Virtual Gate"" function can be very useful for larger houses (> 2000 sq ft?). One can then divide the house into 2-4 areas, manually place the Roomba at one end of your house, and have it clean area by area inward from that point. By alternating which end of the house where you start the Roomba you can potentially get more systematic cleaning, and you can further place it in any area that needs immediate attention. BUT NOTE!, all this requires manually moving the Roomba about, and conflicts with its advertised scheduling function. I'm guessing the instructions are poor due to this conflict with the marketing department! To do scheduled cleanings as well, it only makes sense to place the Home Station in an area that gets the dirtiest, and then supplement that cleaning with the manual method just described. My smaller 1500 sq ft home gets great results just letting the Roomba loose twice per week to clean with its algorithm. No manual fussing about is required for my smaller house.2) A much smaller point is that the Roomba still uses NiMH batteries. Expect Lithium batteries in the future which will take up less space and probably allow for a redesign and upgrade of the entire Roomba. The only unit I know of that utilizes Lithium batteries is the Iclebo which gives a 1 year warranty on them versus the 6 month warranties for the NiMH types.Update (June 30, 2015):I have modified my commentary and description of the LightHouses. Seen Con #1 above for that new commentary. Once this function is understood it is more a Pro than a Con for big house owners.Update (June 13, 2015):After a month I am even more blown away with the awesomeness of this product. My house has never been so clean with next to no work! Currently I have programmed Max to clean my 1500 sq ft house twice a week starting at 5:00 am. I only keep my bedroom door closed so he does not wake me. He typically does his job in a bit less than one hour and has always returned to the base station by the time I have woken. Later I just put him in my bedroom, close the door, and manually return him to the base when he is finished there. I am only using one of ""light houses"" in virtual wall mode to keep him out of a stairwell. On its own Roomba will not fall down the stairs but generally goes far enough to drop its front wheel (which causes it to issue a warning and then turn itself off). I highly recommend getting an air compressor to blow out the filter from the inside after each use. I have also taken to weighing my dust bin with a kitchen scale so as to better judge how often to schedule the vacuuming. Right now I am getting about 4 grams of debris each session. I also want to mention one potentially significant negative. It is possible that this Roomba with its ""aeroforce"" rubber cylinders imparts more wear on a carpet than does an ordinary vac"

5/16/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,IRobot 880 is no joke,"I recently visited a good friend of mine, and his family purchased the IRobot (i think it was the 500 series).Ê They loved it.Ê His wife is a neat freak for sure, and she loves it.Ê She especially likes how it leaves nice straight lines in her carpet, and her cleaning service told her the house is much cleaner when they visit.Ê Before that visit, I never would have considered the Irobot...i just thought it was a novelty that probably didn't work..(kind of like the Sharpe Image Air Purifiers I got burnt on).I have a 5 room ranch house, with a large hallway (all hardwood with a few rugs).Ê It takes me forever to sweep and vacuum, and it's nearly impossible to get all the dirt/dust picked up.Ê So I decided to look at the Irobot, and I purchased the 770 through amazon. Before I used it for the first time, I did a DEEP cleaning of my house, to give it a good baseline to start with.Ê I THOUGHT it was a deep cleaning...I could not believe the amount of dirt and dust that was inside the receptical.Ê It was really unbelievable.Ê The only problem was, the 770 doesn't work with lighthouses (i thought they all did), and it only effectively cleaned 3 of my rooms.Ê Amazon was awesome, took the unit back, and I bought the 880.Ê At this point, I was okay with spending more money, because I knew it worked, and from all the reviews, the 880 was even better.It came with 2 lighthouses, I bought 2 more and this thing runs for 2 hours straight, cleaning all 5 rooms.Ê I keep a 6th room closed off (storage room for now), but it would do that one too without a problem.Ê The vacuum is definitely more powerful, the receptical is much larger and it looks very cool.Ê I noticed the 770 would drive over dirt/dust and once in awhile would not pick it up. The 880 sucks up everything.Ê The dirt detection is also amazing to watch.Ê It somehow senses a dirty area and focuses on that area for awhile.Ê It's amazing.I highly recommend it.Ê I have it scheduled every day at 5:30am (also my alarm).

I have mostly hardwood floors and it cleans them with no problem. It easily changes from a hard floor to a carpet. It gathers dust, pet hair and particles that you can't see. It is ultra easy to empty its dirt container, and yes it will find its way back to its base and re dock when it is low on a charge. It struggles a bit with deeply embedded pet pair in a rug. That is really my only disappointment other than the fact that my cats haven't taken a ride on it yet."
5/22/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,NO LONGER KNEED DEEP IN PET HAIR!,"I received this for Mother's day so I have had it only a short time, but I am flabbergasted at how well it works and kicking myself for not getting one years earlier.Ê We have a 130 lb., Great-Dane sized Great Pyrenees/Anatolian Shepherd mix who sheds year round and who we let run both in and outside.Ê We have a 5000 sq foot one-story home, and 4 active boys and once you get an initial cleaning done in each room, this Roomba does an amazing job of keeping up the dog hair and dirt that are tracked in.Ê --I am not one of those who requires everyone to remove their shoes so we track in lots of dirt and so does our dog.Ê It's been a real battle to control the hair and sand but for the first time in years, my floors are not covered in sand and pet hair!Ê We have Saltillo tile and wood through out, with 5 or 6 area rugs and this keeps it all up.Ê I rotate it through the house now, having it do two or three rooms per day so every room gets a thorough vacuuming about every 3rd day.Ê My only dig is that the battery does not last long enough --about 1.5 hours, and then it needs to charge for 4 or so to get back to that same run time.Ê Requires some thought to run it in the morning and then get it back to the dock to charge so that you can run it again later.Ê I don't use the scheduler as much.Ê It doesn't always find the dock on it's own but I can live with that.Ê Amazed with it and it's very strong vacuuming power -better than my dirt level and in such a small package.Ê Some complain about the noise, but for a vacuum, it is very quiet.Ê You can have a conversation over it for sure, though why not run it in the next room while you talk?Ê Haven't tried anything but the 880.Ê For my next trick, I will be ordering the 4400 mAH lithium battery so I can get a longer run time."
12/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Rita(my roomba),I received this amazing product as a present from my in laws and have fallen in love with it in just 3 days. The amount of dirt and dog hair it cleaned up in two days of my house that I thought was clean blew me away and was kind of disgusting to be honest. We have 3 dogs and carpet in the bedrooms and wood/tile throughout the rest of the house. It did really well on the wood/tile floors but where I was really amazed was in the rooms with carpet. The rubber parts on the bottom really pull the pet hair out of your carpet that you have no idea your regular vacuum is missing. It has only been a few days but I can honestly say this roomba exceeded my expectations. The best part is knowing I have one less thing on my ever growing list of things to do.

This vacuum is amazing. It cleans in a way I can't explain. I have two kids and two Persian cats and my floors and carpets are spotless. I have the newest Shark model and still leaves a lot of hair and dirt behind, but when Roomba vacuums I cannot fine single piece of hair and I love that nothing gest stuck in the rollers type of brushes this new Roomba model has."

2/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,I really love this vacuum,"I really love this vacuum. I hate cleaning house, but this thing does the vacummimg for me.Ê It does a good job at keeping the floors clean since it runs everyday. I alternate it every other week on the different floors of my house. My only complaint with the vacuum is that it doesn't always find its way back to the charging station, so you have to go searching for it so you put it back on the charger"

09/03/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Beware that only SOME replacement parts are available.,"I really like this vacuum in many ways and wanted to give it five stars.Ê But six months after the warranty expired, the handle broke where it attaches to the body.Ê I called customer service to get a replacement, only to be told that none is available and I should just pick the unit up with two hands.Ê I was astounded that all replacement parts are not available from this company for a $600 machine.Ê It's a good thing this happened before I purchased additional products from them, because they have just lost two future sales.Ê So consider this before you buy."
2/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Two Thumbs Up!,"I really like it, so far it is meeting my expectations and picking up the very fine pet hairs we can't keep up with. Its truly amazing what it picks up. We program it to run daily for one hour, it is keeping the pet hair off the floors."
06/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Perfect little vacuum,"I read many reviews for each type of irobot vacuums available and decided this was the right one for us. I have really long hair so having the ease of cleaning out my hair was a must! I am so happy with it! We just got hardwood floors throughout our whole house and realized that there is a lot of crumbs and hair that accumulate everyday. (I have 2 small dogs that shed lightly and a 2 year old so the mess is frequent). We named ours Felicia and our daughter likes to remind us everyday to ""turn on Felicia""Pros:- my hair doesn't tangle in the brush and is really easy to remove (just remove the brushes and its gathered at the end)- the house is significantly cleaner by turning it on everyday (when we skip a day or two I start to notice the accumulated dirt/hair/crumbs)- we have a big house and battery lasts long enough to vacuum everywhere upstairs and downstairs- the lighthouses work well and keep the roomba out of certain rooms if need be (I have noticed that if you put it down after the vacuum has already started that it sometimes doesn't work and I will find her in the room even though I put the lighthouse at the doorway)- she gets even the smallest dog hair but also gets the big crumbs- transitioning from the rug back to hardwood floor is breeze for it even if it has frills at the edges of the rug- you can schedule it to clean everyday at a certain time which is convenient- its super gentle when it bumps the walls and furnitureCons:- it is noisy but I don't mind it (the house is always loud with a kid around)- it doesn't maneuver around as well as I thought but again we have a big house so it has many hallways and rooms to cover. Sometimes I have to go look for her and move her to another room if she has been there too long.- docking station is light so sometimes she will have a hard time getting back on it if it moved a little but its been rare moments when that really happens- if the bin is full it only has a little red light that turns on but it doesn't beep or let you know so you have to check on her often if you know your house is messy but this gets less a problem after a month of vacuuming. Also if you have a new rug be prepared to empty the bin a lot because it gets all the fuzz (see below for more info).Keep in mind:- you will have to roomba proof your house and by that I mean: first few times follow it around and see where it might get stuck or move cords etc.- if you bought a new rug be prepared for it to get a lot of the fuzz that new rugs tend to have which makes the bin full and you have to empty it frequently.Overall completely satisfied and super happy that we decided to purchase this!"
6/24/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great for picking up hair,"I purchased this vacuum about a month ago and I love it. I run it in a different room each night and the floors always look clean now. With the regular vacuum, I had to clean out the rollers every couple of rooms because of hair getting wrapped around the brushes. I still pull the hair off the rollers but it comes off really easy instead of being all tangled in the brushes. I like that I can do other things while it's running. It does a good job too. It goes under furniture and around chairs, etc. It cost more than I planned to spend on a vacuum but it was worth it."
8/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,Neither Amazon nor Roomba will stand behind an expensive product that must be replaced twice within 90 days. Don't Buy!,"I purchased this from Amazon. Within 30 days, it had a fatal error and the manufacturer replaced it with another ""new"" roomba. I was advised 2 days ago that it must also be replaced. I asked for a refund instead from the manufacturer, and because i bought it from Amazon, they won't. And Amazon won't because it's past 30 days. I have now had 2 roombas, 3 weeks for the first one, 6 weeks for this second one. They leave rat tails all over the floor, dust pan is small and does not fill up, yet my older Neato that is upstairs, twice the dust bin size, is completely full when I put it on the floors the roomba just finished.Ê This poor poor cleaning may be due to the fact this second roomba is also defective, or it may be all.Ê I will not recommend this at all. Not sure how I'm going to get money back for this bait and switch of replacing and then oops, your replacement is beyond your 30 days so sucks to be you.Ê First ever transaction with Amazon that I am completely disappointed beyond belief and not sure what I'm going to do about this. First interaction with Roomba and I know it will be the last.Ê Today I received an email from Roomba say, just kidding, we won't replace it now that you want a refund. Just hold down the clean button and it should reset it self.Ê I did several times prior to contacting them. So now, not only will it clean poorly, it only clean poorly when I am home to start it.Ê Either iRobots Roomba or Amazon need to find a way to fix this. You don't get to sell poorly performing expensive merchandise, and pass off accountability."
11/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,The Jetsons!,"I purchased the Roomba after long consideration. A coworker had one and highly recommended it. When I first purchased the vacuum, I was skeptical - I have two cats, two large dos, and four children - lots of mess! The Roomba has surpassed all expectations and has surprised me with its power and thoroughness. It is quite nice to start the Roomba, leave to go shopping, and then return to freshly vacuumed floors!"
05/10/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Like a Dishwasher, you will wonder how you ever lived without it.","I purchased my first Roomba over a year ago (the 650 for pets).Ê I thought about that purchase for 2 years before I decided to do it.Ê The price was a big factor in what took me too long.Ê As soon as I used it, I instantly regretted not purchasing one years ago.Ê I use it just about everyday and it's still going as well as day 1 with regular cleaning and filter changes.Ê When Amazon offered me the 880 Roomba, I was floored (ha).Ê This is an amazing (and yes expensive) piece of equipment.Ê The 880 immediately looks a bit slicker out of the package than the 650 and the brush design and filter is completely changed. I love that it already came with everything needed for the virtual walls and a remote!Ê I have been running it all around the house for a few weeks.Ê I have two incredibly messy toddlers, lots of thick area carpets on wooden floors.Ê The new 880 is quieter than the 650, my husband loves that because although we often run it during the day or times when less people are around the house, he is typically at his home office.Ê The 880 lives up to the Roomba name and does a fantastic job cleaning, it seems ""smarter"" than the 650 and gets the job done faster.Ê The rubber brushes are so ridiculously easy to clean compared to the 650.Ê I felt the 880 did a better job with dust and allergens but the old brush design did about 10% better on my carpets at getting all the loose carpet fibers.Ê I can live with that, it's still great.Ê I also feel the compartment holds a little less dirt and my shaggy carpets can fill up the Roomba quickly."
4/16/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Suzanne is Close to Perfection:Ê Wonderful Everything,"I purchased my 870 (same as 880, but missing a cool remote control) directly from iRobot, as it was not available from my favorite retailer, Amazon.Ê I am so favorably impressed with Suzanne (my lovely Roomba 870) that I wanted to share the love with you.Ê This is my 4th Roomba, so I have a bit of experience with the device.Ê If you're not much of a reader, here is the BOTTOM LINE:Ê If you like the wholeÊ Roomba idea, just BUY THIS MACHINE.Ê It is the apotheosis of Roomba.Ê You will love it.(1) Cleaning.Ê I have three dogs (2 terriers and one Rottweiler, thanks for asking) and they generate lots of hair which has caused my previous Roombas to have major problems with hair on the brushes - I had to remove and clean the brushed after nearly every run.Ê Even the upgrade did not help much.Ê This new (no kidding, really NEW) design sends the hair straight to the bin.Ê There is NEVER hair on the brushes!Ê I have NEVER had to clean the ""extractors"".Ê Never.Ê The rugs look as if they have been steam cleaned.Ê Wow!(2) Bin Capacity.Ê Others have complained about the small capacity of the dust bin.Ê I, too, was really annoyed when the bin filled up in less than an hour while cleaning a carpet that had already been cleaned by a huge noisy vacuum operated by Christine, (the machine simply, the world's best house cleaner and garden organizer).Ê THERE IS NO PROBLEM, because Roomba had just removed a pile of dust and dog hair from a carpet that looked clean!Ê I ran Suzanne (the Roomba) every 12 hours for a 3 days, and the bin filled up every day.Ê On the 4th day, the bin was only partially full, and the carpet was starting to look new.Ê On the 6th day, the bin was just a little full.Ê In other words, her bin fills up because Suzanne finds dirt that others miss.(3) Christine Changes.Ê Because Suzanne is so good, Christine only needs to vacuum those little corners that Suzanne can not get into.Ê This leaves more time for other cleaning, like blinds and doing magic in the garden.Ê The big vacuum simply is not used for floors anymore.(4)Ê Terriers Attack!Ê When Suzanne is cleaning a room, the dogs just leave the room.Ê For my first Roomba, I started it cleaning and then went into town for breakfast.Ê I came home to find the Roomba on its back and my male Terrier, Captain, looking really guilty.Ê They now get along OK, although I do not believe that they will ever be friends.(5) Algorithm Upgrade?Ê Sorry, iRobot, I can not see signs that the new algorithms are much more intelligent than before, except that Suzanne is less hungry for cords than her predecessors.Ê From time to time, Suzanne will get stuck under a small chair - something about the close spacing of the 4 legs that confuses her.Ê Like most Roomba owners, I have made a few changes to my house to make it Roomba compatible, e.g., getting cords off of the floor.Ê So far, so good.Ê My measure of success is the percent of the time that Suzanne makes it back to her charging station.Ê We're running about 50% for a very large and complex first floor of my house.Ê (My own charging station is my recliner.Ê Christine might like a 6-pack.)(6)Ê Cost.Ê Yes, it is expensive, but so is my Lexus.Ê Both cases I can afford and I enjoy both.Ê Still, I AM a bit irritated by how CHEAP iRobot was for an item that costs so much!Ê Example:Ê Only ONE extra filter is included.Ê Two of the cheaper Virtual-Wall units were included, rather than the way-cooler Virtual Wall Lighthouses.Ê Furthermore, it would have been nice if the Virtual-Wall devices used a standard size, rechargeable battery, rather than a standard size battery that gets thrown away after use.Ê I do not mind paying for quality, but naked greed is such a turn-off.Ê So, I gritted my teeth and bought a charger and a few rechargeable batteries.Ê While on the subject of batteries, Suzanne does seem to clean significantly longer than previous Roombas.Ê Still a mystery why the lithium battery in my tablets last forever, but the lithium battery in my Roombas seem to require replacement every couple of years.(7)Ê Dock.Ê Nice job here, as the power supply is incorporated into the dock, so there is less junk (and wires) on the floor - less for Christine (of, more likely, me) to trip over.If you made it this far reading this too-long review, thanks for your patience.Ê I really wanted to get the word out.Ê BTW:Ê Christine does not know of my fondness for Suzanne, but there are signs that she is a little suspicious.Ê My wife likes the Roomba, but less than me.Ê Sorry about having to discuss the lovers quadrangle, but it really is critical to understanding the review."

6/24/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Amazing little guy!,"I purchased irobot room a 880Ê about a month ago from Bed Bath and beyond using a 20% off coupon (saving $140!).Ê We named it Puck :)Ê What an incredible little guy!!!Ê I have it clean on the first floor which consists of three bedrooms, one bathroom, entryway, long hallway, kitchen, dining room, and living room. It does a wonderful job cleaning on one battery charge (about 2 hours).Ê We have a shepherd mix and four cats that roam around on this level of the house and are in FULL shedding mode.Ê A nice feature is that you can set the I robot to clean seven days a week however I do not use this feature because before I run Puck I want to make sure that there is nothing in its way let alone a nasty regurgitated cat fur ball from one of the cats for it to run over.Ê I also like to be around to help Puck maneuver around the house.Ê I think because the layout of my house is so long it has a hard time to find its way back to Dock even with the virtual light houses. In a more square or rectangular home I think it would find its way easier.Ê The compartment for dirt and debris and fur isn't huge but for me it's not a big deal because I'm usually somewhere around the house cleaning whenever I have Puck vacuuming.Ê Puck will also periodically shut itself in the bathroom (because it can push the door shut) to do its businessÊ and unfortunately it does not have opposable thumbs and cannot reach the doorhandleÊ to let itself outÊ haha. I usually have to empty it at least once during its cleaning cycle but it is A LOT of fur.Ê An added bonus is that it will pick up tidy breeze cat pellets that my cats kick out of their litter box. It hasn't fallen down the steps yet so it's Cliff detector works. I love this little thing!Ê Wish I didn't wait to get it as long as I did.Ê All good vacuums are relatively expensive but at least this one does most of the work for you :)"

10/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Not As Good As I Had Hoped (And Thought I'd Paid For),"I owned one of these quite a few years ago, not long after they were first introduced to the market.Ê That one was very expensive, and had been a Christmas gift to me.Ê I also owned a competitor's model 3 or 4 years ago, a little less expensive (inflation factored in too) that gave out after about a year.Ê This one is my third adventure in robot vacuums.Ê To be fair to all three, I have always had, and have now, several dogs, and they do tend to up the ante significantly with respect to household dirt and debris.Ê Of course, I also own a traditional vacuum, but with my work schedule it's rare that I have time to use it more than once a week, when I clean the entire house to within an inch of its life.Ê My decision to try another Roomba had to do with that lack of time, and my interest in not living in a kennel between manual cleanings.Ê All this stated...I still think the Roomba is very steeply priced for what it is.Ê I work in a high-tech company, and as much as I appreciate the many significant design and logic improvements in the 880 over the one I had years ago, I don't genuinely think, now that I've had this one for several months, that it's quite worth the asking price, and the price here was the best one I could find on it.On the plus side, I like the programming it offers, and that it now comes with two door / entry sensors - neither of which I've used, because my home is entirely one level.Ê I like that it now allows cleaning of either carpeted or hard flooring of its own adjustment, rather than me having to manually adjust / set up sensors / reprogram, as in the old days.Ê I like that I can set up a schedule for it over a week's cadence, and given my particular circumstances, I have mine programmed to run every day.Ê It does clean better than its much earlier predecessor, and as well as the competitor's model that I had a couple of years back.Ê It also doesn't get ""stuck"" (under couches, going over rugs and door mats, over power cords, amongst the legs of the 6-place dining set it negotiates here at my home) as much as either of the other two robot vacuums I've owned.Ê It has reasonably good dustbin capacity, and I don't find myself having to empty it DURING a cleaning, but always on a daily basis, which isn't too bad.On the minus side, I have already noticed a reduction in power, so it won't ""climb"" a very slight level change between my (hardwood-floored) great room and my (tiled) kitchen, sunroom and office area, without a struggle, whereas it used to make that transition without hesitation.Ê That tells me that even though I've only had it for a few months (granted, with daily use), I'll be replacing the power pack soon.Ê There are definitely IMPROVEMENTS in the spin-roll design over the brushes of the earlier version (as well as the competitor's design).Ê But they're still not very robust, and I find that I very frequently need to flip the unit over, remove and clean those up and cut hairs, etc., loose, to keep them operating smoothly, and clear the uptake vent behind them.Ê If I don't do this every/other use, that uptake vent WILL get clogged with dog hair and debris, and because I can't really ""trust"" that this won't happen, I have to sort of listen to the sound of the little motor to stop the unit and clean out that vent when it ""sounds"" muffled, or it will just keep running, but will pick up nothing -- in fact, ironically, this just happened again, as I was writing this.Ê And lastly, I am VERY irritated to find, despite routine maintenance to keep hairs or anything else from causing it to bind, that the edger spin brush has stopped rotating, making the unit essentially useless along walls and furniture legs.Ê I *THINK* I've bought the extended protection plan, but I'm going to try unscrewing that brush and see if a cleaning and some lubricant will get it running again, without having to send it back and doing without for however long it takes to get it repaired and returned to me.Bottom line -- I do appreciate the daily cursory clean up it affords me, but that doesn't make it necessarily AFFORDABLE for me, and I kind of wish I had waited a year or two longer before trying a Roomba again - especially at the top of the line, and at this price point.Ê As stated earlier, I work for a high-tech company, and I have a pretty good idea what it likely costs to manufacture this thing.Ê There must be some highly-paid developers and SW designers to justify this price point, and a healthy margin, because the cost is not in the unit itself.Ê I would call this a very light-duty novelty for those who can afford it, and if they can spend the money on something like this, they can probably pay someone to come in and clean once or twice a week, and get dusting and clean bathrooms too."
08/04/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,That one did a great job on the pet hair,"I owned another Roomba but I got tired of having to clean out the brushes all the time because of our golden retriever's hair.Ê That one did a great job on the pet hair.Ê I think it's the 365 model that I have.Ê I bought this new one so I could give my old one away.Ê Since it was so much more expensive than the 365 I thought it would do a better job.Ê I read the reviews saying that it was good but I'm just not all that excited about this model.Ê It has a different way of handling pet hair it appears.Ê Instead of just sucking it up, it sort of chops it up when going over rugs.Ê Then it seems to leave little clumps of hair and doesn't manage to pick them up.Ê I thought I could just program this to run nightly and I would be able to maintain clean floors.Ê I always have to get out the regular vacuum to get the rest of the pet hair up.Ê Even some smaller stuff it leaves on the floor.Ê I'm wondering if I have a defective model because this just doesn't seem to pick up as good as the previous model I owned."
11/01/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Works great for dog hair!,I owned a Roomba a few years ago and I was very disappointed by it. But I took the chance again and it is well worth it. I own a black lab and a pit/boxer mix and this little robot cleans up all of the dog hair I can through at it without a fuss. If you are looking at getting a Roomba to help conrol pet hair this will work. Just remember to keep the bin empty.
4/23/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Corrects the Biggest Problem IÕve Had with My Older Roomba,"I own a Roomba 660 Pet Vacuum that has performed perfectly for 1+ years.Ê I have been delighted with its performance, cleaning under as well as around furniture and picking up hair from a long-haired cat who sheds copiously throughout the spring. My only complaint about this vacuum is that it picks up cat fur and winds it around the rubber brush. Although not impossible, it is very difficult to remove the wound-up fur. Otherwise, however, the 660 is a great vacumm, cleaning the house for 1Ê hours each day, returning without fail to its docking station for recharging.When offered the opportunity to use the newest pet and allergy Roomba (880), I did not anticipate enjoying it any more than my older, but still not so old, Roomba (660).Ê As often happens, I was wrong.Ê This new Roomba comes with a significant improvement over my old, much-appreciatedÊ 660. There are no brushes! This Roomba cleans with rubber(?) rods that operate in opposition to each other, sweeping up pet hair and dust without wrapping hair around brushes.Ê Debris is then deposited in the vacuums bin for easy disposal.Ê That gets rid of my least favorite choreÊ removing pet hair from the brushes of the 660.I have a long-haired cat, a short-haired cat and a Yorkie.Ê Not only do they leave hair behind, especially during spring shedding, they also bring in a ton of dust and debris from the yard.Ê Every day!Ê I can program this vacuum, like the 660, to start up on its own, every day, which means that Im getting a consistently cleaner home with an important reduction in allergens.Ê My coughing and sneezing is reduced, although opening doors for pets and people still allows a certain amount of allergens to come inside.Ê I have set the vacuum to run daily automatically, so you might think it finds little to suck upÊ by the end of the week.Ê Not so!Ê Even running every day, this vacuum still finds dust to suck up.Does it do a better job of cleaning than my old 660?Ê Its hard to make a call on this point because the carpet was already fairly clean, having been cleaned daily by the 660.Ê The 880 appears to pick up more dust but less debris than the 660.Overall, Im pleased with this new Roomba.Ê I am happy to recommend it to all pet owners, but, in case youre dismayed by the price of this newest Roomba, consider the 660 as an alternative.Ê Although it lacks the newest features of the 880, its a great value at just over half the price.By the way, when you register your Roomba 880, the irobot company will send you a little gift.Ê In my case, it was two new filters, a nice touch I was not expecting."
1/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,"Great little robot, worried about the robot uprising","I originally gave this a bad review for its performance on hard surfaces.Ê I have had to edit the review and change it from a bad review to a good review.Ê Why?Ê The problem on hard surfaces was because I wasn't properly clearing it out after use and there was something jammed in there, blocking it.The problem was human error, not robot error.Now that it is properly cleared, it picks up everything that it needs to pick up.Ê It's a great little robot which keeps my space dust-free with almost no effort on my part.Why four stars instead of five?Ê Because this is a very dumb robot, for all its AI.Ê It has no navigation abilities.Ê It doesn't make a map of the room.Ê It goes in pre-set patterns, like spirals and edge-following.Ê That is effective.Ê It gets the job done.Ê But to really earn five stars, this little robot needs to go to the next level, which means it needs to make a map of the space it is cleaning and clean in a more organized way.Ê Like the other reviewers, at this price point I would expect it to have wifi connectivity and some type of web-based control or monitoring.I'm sure this is coming.Ê Google is prototyping self-driving cars, and some of the competitors for this robot already do map a room.Ê Certainly iRobot is working on more advanced features.Ê Until then, this robot gets 4 stars, and I'm happy with it.Stay alert for the robot uprising!"
10/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,The Bachelor Pad No Longer,"I ordered this not really expecting a whole lot.Ê I have 3 large dogs (GSD) and just replaced my living room carpet with laminate.Ê I never knew how much fur the carpet hid until it was no longer there.Ê There were fur balls everywhere, all the time.Ê No matter how much I brushed them.Ê I would vacuum and within 5 minutes find another big ball of hair.The Roomba has almost eliminated hairballs.Ê I am thoroughly impressed.Ê It has a few different cleaning modes, and depending on the degree of cleaning you expect will help you decide which one is appropriate.Ê The first mode is just cleaning to a room as limited by physical walls and the virtual walls which come with the vacuum.Ê In this mode it will clean the room until it thinks it is done.Ê This mode done a very thorough job and is more than clean enough for me.Ê The other mode is room to room cleaning, where you block off entrances to the other room(s) with the virtual walls.Ê It will then finish cleaning each room before moving on to the next.Ê This is what I have it set for when I have it run on a schedule.Ê The caveat is in the room to room mode it will only stay in each room for 25 minutes so that it can make it through them on a single charge (I assume).Ê This is usually enough for maintenance, but about a once a week I still do the single room clean to tidy up some more.If I run it regularly I can get through most of the house on a single bin.Ê However, with 3 large dogs it does sometimes need to be emptied due to fur consumption.Ê For most people I wouldn't expect it to be an issue.Ê It's not a big deal.Ê The red light comes on, you empty the bin, put it back, hit the button and it keeps going.Ê Still far better than having to vacuum myself!"
6/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,"Good, but doesn't meet advertised expectations.","I ordered this model with high expectations based on customer reviews and friend's recommendations.Ê This vacuum does not quite meet the advertised expectations.Ê A few points to consider before spending the money on this model:It is advertised as ""virtually maintenance free"", but maintenance is required at least once week if you have pets.Ê We have two cats, and their hair frequently gets caught and wrapped around in the front wheel.Ê You can detach the entire wheel base and remove the wheel, so it isn't too difficult to clean.Ê Hair will also clog the spinning brush, but this can be removed and cleaned with a screwdriver.Ê I wouldn't consider this ""maintenance free"", considering parts have to be removed with tools and cleaned at least once a week.The device is also advertised to handle ""any shaped and sized room"".Ê We have a relatively small 1200 ft. condo with a large irregular shaped living/kitchen/dining area, plus two square bedrooms.Ê The device often does not make it in to the bedrooms after cleaning the living room, even though we do have ""lighthouses"" setup at the entrance of each room that are supposed to make sure the Roomba adequately cleans the living room before going in to the bedrooms.We also have a higher rug in the dining room, and the device is unable to detect the rug so it does not clean it.A couple design changes for easier cleaning would make this a 4-star device for the money.Ê If you could program it to understand where high rugs are located so the device doesn't just bump the rug in turn, I would give it a 4-star review.Ê If the navigation could also be improved to better understand your home's layout to make sure it hits all rooms before docking, that would make it a 5-star device for the price.Ê (By the way, it only makes its way back to the docking station ab out 50% of the time when done)"

Once I got it it was just ok , certainly not worth the $700 price tag , my $300 neato did a much better job ... , it would indicate that the bin was full but when I opened it there was hardly anything in the dustbin only to see that it was completely clogged up. This happened on many occasions. I called Amazon to return it , they were very helpful and I received instructions to do so. Once they received the rumba I got an email that they refunded my money minus a $140 restocking fee !!!! Really ??? The lady on the phone never mentioned that , I only had the thing for a couple of weeks .I realize that it was a secondary company , Mr. Vac & Mrs. Sew that they dealt with it but still ....feel that it was outrageous.

I am upgrading to the 880, and the new features work very well. I program mine to clean once a day.Ê I use the lighthouses and my only minor complaint might be that it is a little random about when it decides to go into another cleaning area.

I have a workbench which is too heavy and cluttered to move on a regular basis - this scoots in under it with not problem.Ê It also seems strangely smart about what it can and can't push around.Ê If it encounters small light paper bags or tissue boxes, for instance, it will push them around to get at the rug underneath, but when it bumps into your leg, a chair, or cabinet, it stops, turns, and moves on.It does get trapped fairly easily if you have cluttered floors.Ê It will usually escape but can take time (and battery life) to do so. So I have taken to putting chairs upside down on my dining room table, making sure tray tables are away, etc... to give it more room to work.The thing is quiet as well.Ê I will let it run as I work on my computer or watch TV in the same room.Ê My older cat, spooked by just about anything, doesn't mind the thing and will hang out in the same room as it.Ê My younger cat used to play with it, but it tends to eat her toys so she has gotten aggressive with it recently, I don't think she likes it anymore.I haven't had an issue with maintenance yet - the filter is easy to replace.Ê The rollers got jammed once, but they were easy to remove and unblock.Ê And occasionally I have to untangle cat toys from the little spinning brush on its side."

9/25/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I love my vacuum,"I love my vacuum, I call it Robotin. I have a 1Bed1Bath apartment with carpet in the bedroom and hardwood floors in the rest of the house. It works marvelously for both type of floors. It doesn't get stuck on my furniture. I am aware of not leaving things in the floor, such as shoes and socks. Sometimes I do and the robot gets stuck, some other times it doesn't. If it happens, it's no problem, I just take it out and hit the clean button again. I scheduled it to run every morning, so it wakes me up (I am a heavy sleeper, so it helps me not being late for work). It's not as loud as a traditional vacuum but it's not quite either. It cleans for an hour everyday. I let it rest on the weekends (during this time my HEPA filter is getting dry). I mop my floors once a week. I can be bare foot all the time, its great. I clean my robot once a week as well. I wash the HEPA filter. Take the hair out from the brush, the little wheel, and the 2 tangle-free debris extractors. And of course, I take out the dirt from the dirt container as well. It takes me around 6 minutes to do it and I need a screwdriver. It is very easy and I never have to worry about vacuuming.

8/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Worth the investment,"I love my Roomba. It works well and makes vacuuming easier for me since it's a chore I struggle with post an injury. Here are my pros and cons:Pros:* Very intuitive.* Easy to program a cleaning once a day for any and all days of the week.* Stores in a small area of the room* The battery lasts a long time for a good cleaning.* It goes from carpet to hardwood floor very easily.Cons:* The ""walls/barriers"" that accompany the Roomba don't work too well. Sometimes they strictly work as a wall and never prevent the vacuum from entering the next room, sometimes it doesn't work at all, and other times it works great-- this is all regardless of settings.* It doesn't get the edge where the rug meets the hardwood floors very well.Overall, the product was well worth the money."
04/06/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Very happy I purchased,"I love my Roomba. It works very well on hardwood and does a pretty good job getting the pet hair off of the carpet. For what it doesn't get up, at least it leaves huge chunks that I can easily pick up (like it weaves all the pet hair together). I can deal with that, as once the chunks are picked up (probably leaves 3-4 per room), there is no pet hair on the rug at all. It's a smart machine, and I haven't used a regular vacuum since getting this!"

9/17/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great vacuum! Worth the price!,"I love my Roomba! What a time saver! It vacuums while I do other things! I highly recommend this model over the older ones. It has a much larger dust bin, better battery, and needs much less maintenance. It does great with solid surface floors and area rugs. The bin needs changing quite often with wall to wall carpet because of the carpet fuzz. It performs best when given one room to do at a time.Ê Be sure to do a little prep: get lamp cords off the floor (a small Command strip hook along the baseboard does the trick), pick up clutter, move chairs, footstools, and other items out of the way. It's fantastic at getting under furniture. I use it at my office and my home. It's quiet enough for me to have a phone conversation with it running in the same room.Ê It may be very expensive for a vacuum, but I have found it to be worth every penny!Ê I have saved thousands by getting this and getting rid of my cleaning crew."

It also does an amazing job of vacuuming wood floors and and all our various rugs.Ê It manages to clean around chair legs and gets under things I could not reach with a regular vacuum, and it goes over computer wires and other cords without hassle. It's much quieter than a regular vacuum cleaner.Ê One day I came in and found that it had turned itself off without finishing its job.Ê When I turned it back on it sounded sick.Ê It was very easy to remove the rollers, and I discovered that it had sucked up one of the cat's toy mice.Ê Once the mouse was removed the Roomba worked just fine again.Ê You have to empty the dirt bin after every clean, but it's a snap to do and much easier than doing the vacuuming.Ê When you register it, iRobot will send you 2 more filters."

12/14/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Once I figured out the logistics of how its programming works, this was an absolute Godsend!","I love my Rooma 880! I admit there are some things that could be improved upon, but since I don't think technology is really there, yet, I'm going to go ahead and give this 5 stars.We have a Siberian Husky, an Australian Shepherd, and a Maine Coon cat. All of these animals have one thing in common: fur, fur, so much fur, and death by fur! If we go without vacuuming for about one week, we will literally (not exaggerating - we measured out of morbid curiosity) vacuum about 3 to 5 gallons of fur depending on how compressed it is. With the Roomba running daily, the fur is finally under control.As for the things that I wish technology would catch up with, the Roomba was a bit tricky to figure out in our ranch style home. Also, I imagine if you had a split level home, you would need 2 Roombas to be able to run them daily over the whole house. I'm not sure, but it seems like that would be the case. I'd check out other reviews for that one to be sure.Our house is about a 1500 square foot ranch home with hardwood floors. I was initially having trouble with the Roomba either not cleaning all of the rooms or dying before it could make it back to its dock. I troubleshot getting the Roomba to clean all of the rooms I wanted it to. After some research, I discovered that when I put a Lighthouse in a doorway, that tells the Roomba not to move forward into the next room ""forward"" of the lighthouse until it's done cleaning the room ""behind"" the Lighthouse. Given that some of our rooms are quite large, such as the living/dining room, the Roomba was dying before it finished cleaning or couldn't find its base again. For those of you in similar situations, I suggest removing the Lighthouses altogether. Also, place the Roomba towards the center of the home versus all the way on one side or the other. We now use our Lighthouse/Virtual Walls as virtual walls to keep the Roomba out of the bathrooms as it likes to get stuck behind doors in tight spaces. Without using Lighthouses, the Roomba cleans the entire house as it should. Also, It does at times get stuck in tight spaces around the house where there might be clutter and likes to eat shoe laces or things like iPhone power cords. The solution for this is to remove clutter, open spaces, and (you guessed it) tuck in those shoe laces and power cords!Other than that, the Roomba is great. I let it run once a day, empty it when I get home, and rejoice that I no longer have tumble weeds of fur all over the home!"
07/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Love my IRobot Roomba 880,"I love my IRobot Roomba. I use it every day and often twice a day.We have 2 dogs and three toddlers living with us and our floors remain very clean. I'm also encouraged to pick up every night, so the floor is clear for the roomba. It is amazing how much it picks up on just once cycle!! I will always have a roomba because now we'll never have to vacuum ever!!"
10/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,A good investment in a cleaner home,"I love mine. We have named him Lurch, and usually enjoy watching him wake up automatically every day and scoot around the house doing his chores. Every now and then we have to have him skip a session because he's loud though. And we have to keep our bathroom doors closed because he has a tendency to get stuck on the plush bathroom rugs. And he ate a sock once. He's kind of like a puppy that way, but without the peeing in the floor. And the logic of his cleaning pattern is, shall we say, less than clear. But if we keep obstructions to a minimum (yes, we pick up for the robot more than for ourselves), he does a great job of keeping my hardwood floors clean of dust, debris, and pet hair. He picks up so much I do have to empty his bin every day, and sometimes he will pick up so much in the first 45 minutes he will go back home and dock, waiting to be emptied, before completing his appointed rounds.In summary, he was a pricey investment, but we had just had new hardwood installed and wanted to keep it clean and knew that with our schedule we would not realistically vacuum every day and would otherwise be consigning ourselves to a life of watching husky hair blow across the living room in great tumbleweeds. This is better, and definitely worth it.I haven't seen the cat ride it down the hallway yet though. When that happens, I'll know that we're all pleased with the investment."

It was easy to set up and get started with. Instructions are straightforward and well written. It's amazing to watch, and has quickly become a member of the family as it bustles here and there. It's especially entertaining when it heads directly down the long hall. It's easy to clean. I thought emptying the bin would be annoying, but it's actually gratifying to see all the gunk it picks up. I thought I was a clean freak, but this run circles around me (quite literally!). The sound is rather distracting, so talking on the phone or concentrating on something in Mr. Roomba's proximity isn't easy, but the result is worth going into another room for a while. Already I've noticed a reduction in my morning allergies."

I definitely recommend it, I think it's great!Now a few things I have learned about the most efficient way to use it.Ê I do not program it to work by itself, it gets tangled in wires and I have one piece of furniture it will get really stuck under. In my opinion, if left alone, it spends too much time going over and over the same areas. So I set the virtual wall and place it in the room/area I want it to do. Then I do the same with the other rooms. I might even sweep stuff out of the edges of a room and use the ""spot"" setting to get that stuff. I don't work soÊ have time to do this. I may only have it do one room some days. When I am done, I pick it up and place itÊ in front of the docking station and in it goes.

1/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I named her Karen bc she is like my maid,"I looooove my 880. I named her Karen bc she is like my maid. I am a clean freak as it is and was starting to have a panic attacks when I moved into a large 3 story town house that was 4 times the size of any apartment I've ever lived in and got a kitten and a puppy. I could not keep up with the daily cleaning needs of a large house and new pets and spent my weekends cleaning three levels of floors. Before I jumped put the third story window, my boyfriend bought be the sweeper/mop first. It worked okay, but I told him I sweep/vacuum daily and mop weekly, so a vacuum would be the better option. We returned the sweeper/mop and got the 880 and it has been life changing. I got my weekends and sanity back! I have been using it for a month and still shocked to see what it picks up. I use mine on tile, carpet and area rugs and it cruises over them just fine. I have to do very little prep to make sure it doesn't get stuck on anything. Because it creeps against the wall, sometimes it will close a door and get stuck in that room until it dies as mine cannot find it's dock to go back to if I am using it on another level. I just put something against the door so it wont push it close as some of my doors don't open all the way against the wall and stay there. Other than that I run it daily. I make her work for me and she's amazing! My animals hated it at first but now don't seem to care. I run it downstairs during the day, upstairs after work and I have it set to clean my main floor every night at 3AM. Every morning I wake up expecting not to see anything in it as it runs daily but am always shocked how much dust and small items it picks up. More than my Shark does for sure. When I run it on the carpet, which I have been running it for a month now and it is always full of human, pet hair and dust. I get so grossed out bc I am a clean freak and to know it's still getting massive amounts daily is shocking. I am sure most of it comes from places I don't do often with my Shark, like under the bed. The 880 zooms right under my bed skirt and cleans away. It is strange what it likes and doesn't. I have a very, very thin front door mat that it refuses to go over. I think it knows it will get sucked up bc it's so strong and at first I was picking up my think heavy bathroom rugs bc I was sure it would not go over them and one day by accident I left them down and it was on it cursing slowly over them just cleaning away. I was SHOCKED. Anyways, if you have a busy life and house, this is must have. I don't know how I lived without one for so long. I love the virtual walls it come with. I have a tall bird cage so I put one in front of it so it doesn't bang into my cockatiels cage at 3am scaring her. I also put one by the stairs even though you don't have to with this model bc it can sense the stairs, but I still don't like to risk it. I love it too much to have it broken!"

7/24/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Truly improved my life!,"I just replaced an old Roomba from about 5 years ago with this new one. I am so thrilled with it! I know it's not perfect - and as a prior Roomba user I expected that. But this thing picks up so much out of my area rug that I have now run it about 12 times over the same area rug and it is still filling up the bin. I didn't know it was possible to have that much to vacuum out of a single rug! At this point most of it is loose rug fibers but those were getting tracked around the room so I'm glad they're getting vacuumed up. Kind of makes me glad we have hard wood floors and not carpeting. And this is after using a dyson vac and prior roomba to regularly clean the rug. This 880 is very powerful - when you first start using it stay on top of the bin because once it is full it does keep running and may kick out balls of fiber/dust if it has no where to go. I am a little surprised it doesn't stop and tell you to empty the bin (my previous Roomba did) - but once you're using it regularly and it has already deep cleaned everything I don't think this will matter for regular use.I currently have it set to run at 5am every day in the same 2 main rooms. I wake up, empty the bin, and then set it to work somewhere else. I love this - it can go under things and it keeps our house so much cleaner because I use it daily. We have a yellow lab, a school aged daughter, and we live in a beach town. To keep up with the floors I would need to drag out the dyson every single day. Now I only have to use it for little things here and there.My only wish is that it could handle the transition from the hard wood to the carpet better. But honestly I'm not sure how it could. It has no trouble getting up on the area rug but there is always a little dust or fibers that remain along the edges of the rugs because the Roomba can't suck those up while climbing up on the area rug. So that's where I might use the Dyson to run it along the edges.This truly makes my life easier and I love having it. It's also much, much quieter than previous models. I'm happy.UPDATE:It's been about a month since I bought the first one and I just bought a second one. Now I have one in each of our two main rooms and they both run at 5am. I love waking up to super clean floors!! I love these things!"

DO NOT BUY!","I just received this unit and opened it to find, to my horror, that the unit was FILTHY, clogged with long, black hair and the collection bin was filled with cat dander and dust, which immediately activated my allergies, causing my face to swell and my vision to blur. There is nothing on this product listing that suggested this would be a rejected item, and -- let me be clear -- this is NOT a ""refurbished"" item. There were fingerprints all over the cover as well as the filth on the outside and the hair/dander inside.I'll be returning this item, filing a complaint against the merchant and buying a unit directly from iRobot to try out what looks like a neat technology.

08/05/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Is it wrong to be in love with a vacuum?,"I just love it but within 3 months I have had to replace HEPA filter 3 times, the sidebrush once, and the debris extractors once. Noticed it wasn't cleaning as well as it had so replaced HEPA filter and sidebrush but still no improvement. New debris extractors was exactly what was needed to get it working as well as it had in the 1st 2 months.User's manual states that debris extractors should be replaced every 12 months so having to replace them more on the order of every 3 months is a bit costly. Still extremely happy with the product and have not for a moment regretted this purchase. A two dog home really benefits from daily use of this terrific product. And the design of the debris extractors make short work of cleaning them as they are not brushes that would quickly get tangled with dog fur, but rubber rollers that absolutely do not get tangled up with fur. It effortlessly moves from carpeting to hardwood to tile without any problems and the cliff-sensor keeps it from falling down stairs 100% of the time.The 880 even tells you when to clean the extractors and when to empty the bin. Parts that need to be monitored for cleaning are all colored yellow to be recognized easily and are designed for easy access for cleaning. A truly wonderfully thought out, designed, and effective product. Highly recommend this vacuum and have told everyone in my orbit about it!"
12/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,It is a good product just not for my house,I just hate that the dirt container is so tiny you have to constantly empty it and the battery doesn't last that long.

5/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Amazing Little Critter!,"I initially decided to buy this little guy for myself - as a kind of extravagant Mothers Day gift, and an indulgence.Ê But now my viewpoint has evolved.Ê This little critter began as an entertainment...then became impressively functional.Ê I spent time on the first use, setting up the areas that Little Robot should be kept away from.Ê Once the trouble spots were identified, the little worker-bee went to town cleaning thoroughly.Ê I have two floors to my home, and he can clean one entire floor totally without having to re-dock for an energy recharge.Ê He seems to like being under beds and other items of furniture, so I've put up some obstacles so that he focuses more on the center parts of each room.Ê Even though I've used this dirt chomper several times now, I'm still so amused with watching him do his thing.Ê Always wanted my own private robot!!Ê This is a 2-in-1 prize...entertaining AND functional!Ê Makes vacuuming a non-work activity, and I can sit at my desk and take care of other duties while my house gets cleaned without my participation."
05/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,I heard such great reviews about this,I heard such great reviews about this... Its cleans like a human in your house.. it doesn't clean the same spot twice. it doesn't fall off the stairs.. it has supper sensors bla bla bla but its not all true. But the reason I decided to give it 4 stars and keep the Roomba is because Yes it true it goes around the whole house the house still looks dusty and dirty but when its time to empty out the Roomba its full of dust and dirt which shows me that I could have been breathing more dirt if I didnt have the Roomba going around everyday and doing what it does. So dont expect to see your house clean when you return but when ur emptying out the little bin you will notice that it actually does pick up dirt... The noise is kinda loud I wish they can work on that. Sometimes it goes into my bathroom or pantry and looks the door on itself and stays there till the battery is dead or the time is up.. Lol thats funny and sad.
8/20/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Not worth the cost,"I heardÊ many good comments from others who have the Roomba and after several weeks of reading reviews I paid the $700 to purchase which was a big mistake. Guess I expected more from reading the reviews, however I was extremely disappointed. It does pick some things however the bin is extremely small so you will end up emptying frequently. Have had numerous issues with unit docking to soon, not finishing the cycle. I want sent a replacement battery after numerous conversations with their tech support, however that did not correct the problem. The virtual lighthouses do not work very efficiently either. Bottom line do spend your hard earned cash on this product."

6/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Excellent performance,"I have used three of the Neato vacuums for several years, and found them decent, but not a replacement for regular vacuuming with a good upright on carpet. The Neato's ""intelligent"" mapping of the room was somehow appealing. The Roomba is *much* better at cleaning carpets, and I think it could replace a good upright. I am using two of the Roombas and they are all-around excellent. The seemingly stupid random wandering of the Roomba seems to actually contribute to the cleaning power because it is constantly going over the same spots, and from different angles. The downside is that it takes much longer than the Neato to complete a room, but since you don't have to be there, I don't see that it matters. Also, the battery life of the Roomba seems to be three or four times greater than the Neatos, which often had to recharge during the job. The Roomba can do a 1,000 square foot carpeted area without recharge and do it really well. It also gets hung up on objects only very rarely, much less often than the Neato. I did have to buy two ""Halo"" units to prohibit its entering some very tricky places.The one modification to the Roomba that I would suggest is to add material to the front bumper, which is the entire front half of the machine. I used one inch-wide, self-adhesive Velcro, only the soft (loop, felt-like) strip. I have one strip all the way around the top of the bumper, another along the bottom (over the original rubber bumper). This modification not only saves furniture, baseboards and door jambs from scuffing or impact damage, it almost completely silences the operation of the machine. Amazon sells the Velcro as ""VELCRO Brand - Industrial Strength - Extreme - 1"" Wide Tape, 10' - Black."""
12/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,"The honeymoon is over, but it's still a great helper!","I have two very hairy dogs that shed in large fluffs, plus I have long hair. My husband, fortunately, is bald, but it still doesn't make up for us three other hairy critters in the house! I run the Roomba daily, and it has really helped. I have now, however, gotten past the starry-eyed-in-love-with-my-new-robot-slave stage and can share some issues. Pros of the Roomba are easy - it is a robot that does your vacuuming for you! Amazing. Worth it. The house is waaaay cleaner than it would be if we didn't have one. Plus, we keep things picked up to be out of its way, so it has made us neater, too. Okay, onto some nit-picking now!I started with the 770. It cleaned really well, on both carpet and our wood (bamboo) floors, however, cleaning all of the hair out of the brushes, which I needed to do every single day, using the cutting tool and comb that came with it, was way too messy and too much of a hassle. The brushes work better than the brushless rollers of the 880, though, I have to say.I clean the brushless rollers of the 880 daily, too, but they are very easy to clean. I pull the yellow bearings off the ends to clean out the dog hair that is wrapped around the axle, too. I take the wheel out and get the dog hair off the ends of the metal axle, and about once a week push the metal wheel axle out and get the dog hair that is stuck in the middle. I unscrew the side brush and get the hair off of it/out from under it when needed. So it's not really ""low maintenance"" - I still empty the bin daily and clean the rollers and wheel daily, but it is less of a hassle with the brushless rollers.The 770 worked better on carpets and rugs.The 880 has damaged a few of our throw rugs (pulling out threads), and doesn't seem like it gets the larger rugs and carpets as clean as the 770. It also seems to get stuck on the rugs more, and wrinkle them up or flip up the corners.The 770 picked up dog hair better - the problem was that it all ended up wound around the brushes and cleaning those was time-consuming and messy.The 880 picks up the dog hair, but then in rolls it into little doggy dreadlocks and spits it back out. It leaves hair on the edges of the throw rugs, too. The ""doggy dreadlocks"" or as I sometimes call them, ""Roomba poops"" are easier to pick up than loose dog hair, but I have to go around and pick them up, and they do look like poop when you first see them, because of the elongated shape the Roomba weaves them into. Still, even that is better than cleaning the dog hair from the brushes in the 770 - and cleaner, since I would be filthy after doing it.I don't really get the advantage of a HEPA filter when you have to knock it on the side of the garbage bin and the dust you filtered flies up in the air. I started just changing them when they got dirty because I have allergies, which is why I wanted a HEPA filter. That applies to both 770 and 880.Why aren't these made the right size to go under kitchen toe kicks? Both the 770 and 880 occasionally get stuck under the toe kick because of the way the sensor sticks up higher.I've had the 880 for about 8 months, and it is a little worse for the wear. I have replaced the rollers, and the replacements don't seem to fit as well, though they are iRobot brand. The one with the ""square peg"" base (the darker one) seems to get a LOT of dog hair stuck around that end of the axle. Also, the yellow bearings do not come off easily to clean like the originals, but hair still gets under them that I need to clean out. They also got torn up almost immediately because they don't seem to sit as evenly/well in their positions, and the rubber ""skirts"" get torn up. It still works, though.The worst replacement was the side spin brush, though - the screw seemed not to fit as well and it seems like it stripped the threads. Now the side brush comes off sometimes. I went back to the original and it is staying in, but it has fallen out at least once, too. For such an expensive tool, it feels pretty cheap at times.THE BASE (same for both 770 abd 880) is really annoying. about 1/3 of the time, the Roomba pushes it around rather than just docking. It is too light and even though there is a rubber area on the bottom, it just slides around on our wood floors. There is no place to put it in the rooms with carpet, but it might work better there. I don't like that it would prefer to be out in the open somewhere, because I don't really think of the Roomba as part of my home decor! I have it under a chair against a wall in the entry. It's okay, but the plug is on the left and the cord comes out the right side of the base, making it awkward. I would have the dock under the couch if it would dock more reliably and not need me to manually set it in position.Oh, and every once in a while it will get stuck somewhere away from the dock for a long period if we are out of town, and the battery will be completely dead. It will not charge properly in this situation unless I prop up the back end of the Roomba to make it contact the charger better! It also loses its clock when this happens, but not its schedule - so the first time this happened, it came on at 1 in the morning and woke us up. I figured out that the clock was off, and it thought it was 9am on a weekday. So if you ever run the battery all the way down, be sure to check both the schedule and the date and time on the clock!So those are my gripes about my Robot Slave. But the pros are: ROBOT SLAVE!!! So it is still awesome, even if a little annoying."
6/19/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,iRobot Roomba 1.0,"I have tried two other version of the Roomba -- the 770 and 780.Both worked in general for what it was supposed to -- clean automatically and find its way around your rooms. The issue with 700 series was that it would routinely get 'misplaced' around certain items around the house, sometimes die when cleaning and never making it back to the charging station. Moreover, the little 'brushes' that spun while the Roomba was vacuuming would pick up items on the floor that would clog it and they got dirty very fast.This being said, the Roomba 880 is version 1.0--no longer in the 'beta' stages. If you want to begin on the road to robotic vacuuming, this is the one to buy. If you have an older version, the 880 is a great update choice.[---Use---]This vacuum is a necessity to have if your floor is hard i.e. wood, tiles etc.On carpet it will still vacuum however do not expect it to compete with high-end traditional vacuums.The ratings I give it are:Hard Floors - 9/10Carpet - 7/10The Roomba does an excellent job, overall, at vacuuming your floors to pick up dust, hair, and other items it might find. The savings of your time by using the Roomba, it makes up for any minor 'debris' it may miss. I can tell you, though, it does not miss much.Firstly, you program the Roomba to vacuum at certain times during any day--it can be at any hour. Secondly, you let it roam around the house to let it get 'acquainted' with the layout.Ê The latter helps so that it reduces the chances it will get stuck under a low bed or not vacuum thoroughly. After setting the times, the Roomba will automatically start cleaning at the times you selected.[---Sound---]Like the other Roombas except a little quieter. It is about 75% of the volume of your traditional vacuum.----------------------------------------------------As robotic vacuums have been introduced in the market, there have been a variety of models. The consensus on them was usually: lower price=lower quality, Roomba vacuums=the best. As other Roombas had a few issues, this 880 model is the one that other companies will be measuring their product by."

5/19/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Great Vacuum, Terrific Customer Service.","I have this programmed to run daily. It's amazing how much dirt builds up if we miss a day or two. You do have to do some ""robot-proofing"", just as if you had a toddler. It routinely locks itself in the bathroom if someone leaves the door ajar, and has to be rescued. Vacuuming is difficult for me, so this is a lifesaver. I owned one of the early models, and can say with confidence that they have vastly improved since the 400 line.We did have it break down two weeks before the warranty expired. The contact on the bottom where it docks on the charger was overheating and melted the plastic. Contacted iRobot and they sent out a replacement, no questions asked. In a day and age where good customer service is mostly a thing of the past, I was tickled pink that they would send out a $700 piece of electronics without even asking for a credit card to secure it. I don't know what their recourse would have been if I'd not returned the broken one.I do use two virtual walls to keep the robot from crawling under low furniture and getting stuck. They take two C cell batteries each, that have to be replaced every 4-6 months. There's no warning system when they die; the robot just starts ignoring them.There are a few things it can't pick up, like popcorn. And as someone mentioned it can leave a line of crumbs and dust at the transition between carpet and tile. These are small downsides, though. I suspect that if I were inclined to, I could use the remote to run it parallel to this seam and it'd get it all, but it doesn't bother me that much. A neurotic personÊ might be troubled by the wonky wheel patterns it leaves in the shag, but I find it amusing. Robot footprints! It passes over standard electrical cords with no trouble, but will gobble up smaller cords like phone chargers or earbud cords. They tangle and stop the robot. Sometimes you can salvage them, but occasionally they get damaged, so be sure to put them out of reach.In the course of the year I've owned it, I've had to replace the brushes once. The rollers get cuts in them from picking up threads and hair, and the side twirly brush gets bent and ineffective eventually."
02/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Very satisfied.,I have the 880. The set-up and programming was easy. Every morning the waste container is full of pet hair and dander so the house is much cleaner!One night it tumbled down the stairs and broke the bumper. I called IRobot to get it repaired and they sent me another brand new unit for exchange. They advised that my stairs might have too much of a beveled edge or that the edge sensor might have been too dirty to see the edge. I put a virtual wall in front of the stairs just in case and that solved the problem.Highly recommend this product and IRobot!
08/06/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,LOVE. LOVE. LOVE this Roomba!,"I have owned the IRobot Roomba 880 for approximately 4 months.Ê I purchased it to replace the lower end model I had purchased at Costco about three years ago.Ê I decided to invest in the 880 because while I loved my original Roomba, any problems we had with it stemmed from the brush system.Ê The brush-free system is fantastic on our wood floors.Ê I love that it can be programmed, and I don't have to think about it.Ê We have a few throw rugs around and it has no problem navigating those.Ê Maintenance on the vacuum is very user-friendly and only takes a few minutes.Ê It is especially good at picking up our dog's hair.Ê I wish I could get it to do the stairs!Caveat: We are very allergy conscious in my house.Ê Therefore, we do not have carpeting other than the occasional throw rug.Ê So, I cannot vouch for how well it works on carpets."
11/13/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I am in LOVE - with a robot!,"I have no prior experience with cleaning robots, so this review is based solely on my experience with the Roomba 880 and is probably more geared towards people that actually have pets and are trying to keep the hairy mess down.This robot deserves a thorough review, but heres the quick synopsis if you don't want to read it all: I love it, would buy it again. There's a learning curve to use it efficiently, but I would not want to live without it anymore, it has made my life so much easier and cleaner! Maintaining the robot is easy and fast and it does fine on all surfaces it encounters in my house, including under couches and beds. It cleans for up to 2 hours daily. It is not set it and forget itÊ get a cleaning lady if that is what you want.Here is my experience with this little helpful machine for those interested:Out of the box, I thought that while the instructions weren't the best, they were certainly sufficient to get me started. However, when it comes to how to actually place the virtual walls and lighthouses, the instructions are not terribly helpful and it helped me to watch the robot a few times to get used to best placement.I have about 2000 square foot to clean on my main floor, and it is a mix of linoleum, hardwood floors, large and small area rugs and tiles. The hardwood is about 3/4 inch raised above the linoleum and some area rugs are thick (so the robot has to ""climb""). I have a constantly shedding yellow lab, as well as a dark haired cat. So, basically, I had to either vacuum every day or accept that there are some dust bunnies during the days I don't get to it. Now I use my upright vacuum only on the rugs, maybe every other week! Because of the rather large area, I have also purchased some extra virtual walls/lighthouses, so I can better tell the robot where I want it to clean. But my main floor has lots of openings and angles, and I think additional lighthouse/wall units may not be necessary for those with a very open floor plan (two units are included with the robot). My robot is programmed to clean daily while I'm at work during the week and during the afternoon on the weekend. Programming was really easy. To deal with the large area with different amounts of traffic, I switch my lighthouses from the ""lighthouse"" to the ""wall"" function a couple of times a week to have certain zones cleaned more often than others. Sometimes I also take the robot to clean an area after I get home from work, if the robot happened to not go in that area that day and I want it to clean there.How does it clean? Well, I think it does a very nice job of keeping the floors at an exceptional level of cleanliness for a pet household. If you have pets that shed, you will appreciate not having to vacuum every day. There will be *some* pet hair left behind in areas that didn't happen to be vacuumed much that day, but quite honestly, it is so minimal that I would argue that maybe you should have a goldfish instead of a dog or cat if that amount of pet hair bothers you. It is basically never more a few stray hairs here and there if you look really close.The unit is not whisper-quiet. Although not terribly loud, it makes enough noise to bug me if it is cleaning in the same room while Im watching TV or trying to sleep. However, mostly it is running while Im away anyway, so it doesnt really matter. My cat and dog dont mind the robot at all after the initial WTF? reaction. My dog got very excited and kept watching and following the robot around initially. Now he doesnt even move out of the way for it and is recognized as an object if he decides to stand his ground. The cat just kind of doesnt care to be very close to the robot while it is cleaning, but isnt really scared of it, either. He just walks around the robot at a bit of a distance. But I have a brave cat that chases and plays with my 82 pound lab while hes spinning in circles of his happy play dance, so who knows, your cat may go hide or hiss at the robot.Contrary to my initial belief, the robot DOES not ""map"" or ""learn"" the specific room. Instead, it uses routines (aka programmed behaviors), making decisions based on how it bumps into something (e.g. angle) and how often. For example, there are routines for wall following, circling around chair legs, going diagonally across the room, turning around in different angles when it gets in a tight place, and cleaning a spot it deems very dirty in sort of like a star shaped pattern.Ê Due to these various routines, the robot will not go in straight lines back and forth across the area as one would manually with a vacuum cleaner. Expect it to appear random. It is, but because of this it ends up covering the whole area eventually. I have, however, noticed that certain areas do indeed end up getting more cleaning if they happen to induce a certain routine repeatedly due to the location of obstacles.The robot detects walls and slows down before bumping into them, but cant do that for narrow objects like chair legs or corners. It bumps into those at full speed. It is strong enough to push a small wooden plant stand that has an artificial plant on it out of its place a little bit at a time, so dont leave something tippy on a tall, light stand if you can avoid it.Dog toys are not a problem (unless you have a tiny lapdog and equally tiny toys). The robot pushes past soft objects carefully at low speed (including bed skirts and such). It did try to eat a thin arm on a dog toy once, stopped, and needed rescuing.The dirt detection I believe is based mostly on color difference (optical), and I have read that some dark area rugs may cause issues and get the robot to keep doing its spot cleaning routine. I have not encountered this problem, though. Im not sure about acoustical dirt sensing mentioned here on Amazon. Maybe when the dirt is crunchy??? (There is a round metallic window in the middle of the vacuum channel, so that possibly hears when dirt hits it, but who knows?) On hard floors larger debris might get kicked around a bit if it happens to be at the very edge of the robots spinning side brush. It usually is picked up eventually, though.I dont know if the cliff (stairs) detection works, I have not needed that in my house. I also have never used the remote control. I dont find it useful for anything, really. Maybe I should try it out in a rescue operation if the robot ever decides to stop cleaning while it is under a bed. I dont know if it will turn on remotely, though. Ill give that a try some day.Here are some of the lessons learned in terms of setup and upkeep during the past three months with the robot:Placement of charging station and virtual walls/lighthouses:1) Put the charging station for the robot in the middle of the house with additional zones off of that. Do not daisy-chain. Reason: The robot will not return to the charging station in the starting zone (1) if it has to go from zone 3 THROUGH zone 2 to get back to zone 1 to charge (i.e. lighthouses in connecting between connecting rooms). Customer service has confirmed this. I struggled with this before I figured out what is going on. I initially had the robot on one end of the house (kitchen) and wanted it to clean the living room and the master bedroom connected to the living room in stages by using the included two lighthouses. I kept finding the robot out of battery or simply switched off in the bedroom. Now, sith the charger location in the middle of the house, the robot cleans the living room first, and then goes either into the kitchen, the bedroom area, or the library, depending on where it happened to be when the lighthouses switch to pass. After cleaning that secondary room, it goes back to zone 1, and, if the docking routine has not yet come on, it goes to the next zone and back to zone 1 after it is done. This way it now cleans up to three zones off of the living room without issues.2) Do not put the charging station (zone 1) behind a thin wall that separates it from another zone the robot might want to return from to charge after a cleaning cycle. The robot will keep going to that area behind the wall to try to return to the charge station, but, of course, it can't!Ê It will probablyÊ"

09/05/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Roomba,"I have mixed feelings about this Roomba. It does the job, but it takes forever! For one small bathroom, it could run for hours. It gets most of the dirt... good enough for a daily sweep, at least. But if I need the house vacuumed quickly, it doesn't cut it. Out comes ol' Hoover, he does the job in an hour. Roomba takes all day. If you have the guts to let it run all day without supervision, it'll do the job okay, but if you have anything on the floor... a loose rug, pet food/water dishes, shoes with laces, waste-baskets, cords, pet toys, etc., it may get hung up on them (which takes all its juice), or worse yet, spill them over. I've even seen it get hung up on the little ""home base"" it's supposed to go to when it's finished... then it goes all over the room again, trying to find ""home""... I try using the remote to ""guide"" it back home, but sometimes that doesn't work, as the thing just wants to go in circles (not a straight line). I end up picking it up and placing it in the base most times. Anyway, it's a good little thing for a light sweep when you just can't bring yourself to get out the ol' Hoover."
7/31/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"The robots are here, and they want to vacuum your floors","I have held off buying a Roomba for years based on reviews that suggested that iRobot was headed in the right direction, but hadn't quite gotten it right.Ê Well now, having emptied dozens of Roomba dust bins crammed full of dust and dog hair, I'm hooked.This machine cleans far more deeply than you'd expect based on the tiny flying saucer profile.My main problem with the Roomba thus far is that it doesn't always recognize the ""light houses"" that are supposed to confine the unit to a specific area.But what I love is the ability to schedule multiple cleanings per week.Ê Beats waiting two weeks for the maids to arrive."
8/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Impressed.,"I have had this now for 3 weeks and I must say I'm impressed. Jarvis, (yes, you must name it) is scheduled to run everyday when we are at work and so far has been finding his dock almost every day.Ê Jarvis picks up quite a bit of dirt - at first, I was emptying him daily - now its about every 3 days. The house is mostly hardwood and I have him cleaning the downstairs (approx 1800 sq ft.). When I want him to clean the master bedroom I pick him up and let him do his thing for about an hour while I get ready in the morning - and then manually put him back on his base. I have the house sectioned off into three zones and so far all is working well. I found him yesterday, out of battery, in front of our Amazon Echo- Alexa - perhaps Jarvis and Alexa have a thing going! Yes, the price is steep, but it really does workÊ -- and works well. If you can justify it, you won't regret it."
09/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,A super 'helper' to keep floors clean.,"I have had the Roomba for several months now and can honestly say that I love the convenience of it. Initially I was concerned about issues with darkly patterned area carpets but the Roomba has surprised me with its abilities. I have since purchased another model for a small vacation apartment we own and my daughter has purchased her own Roomba after seeing the 880 in action at my house. We especially love the ability to clean regularly under furniture like beds.Ê The first few times I too thought that the dust bin was rather small, however, with regular use it is no problem at all because the floors just don't seem to be as dusty any longer. Since I don't usually clean the whole house at the same time, I have not had any issues with battery life either."
09/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,... the Roomba 880 for just 6 days and I love it! It came with 2 Virtual Wall/Lighthouses but ...,"I have had the Roomba 880 for just 6 days and I love it!Ê It came with 2 Virtual Wall/Lighthouses but I decided I needed a 3rd one.Ê My house is very large. 1760 square feet so I clean each room individually.Ê I found that I do not care for the lighthouse feature because I find it cleans better if you move some furniture and clutter so I have to move small furniture, shoes, etc to other rooms in order to allow the Roomba to thoroughly clean each room.Ê This is where the virtual walls really come in handy.Ê I have done each room 3 times already and I am still picking up quite a bit of dust.Ê I never realized how much my Dyson was actually missing. I believe it was because I would get tired and rush the job and Roomba goes at the same steady pace.Ê I will probably not use the programmable scheduling because I am very particular about leaving ANYTHING running when I am sleeping or away from home.Ê Because of this, the only time it docks itself is when it is cleaning the room/area that has the docking station in it.Ê I read another review where the person uses an air compressor to blow out the filter and clean the machine.Ê That gave me the idea to use the air canister for cleaning my computer keyboard to clean the Roomba filter.Ê Works amazing."
6/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,which on mine it is not doing a great job at cleaning,"I have had the iRobot Roomba 880 for 7 days now and have used it more then 7 times, with complete battery charges every time. This is what is on my mind about the 880, Things you may not read before purchasing that may be helpful if you do. The 880 only runs on a full charge for 1 hour before it returns itself to its home base. In that hour it cleans 4 average to maybe small rooms in a haphazard method, it does miss places, I have swept those places out to center of floor to get it to pick it up which it will do, but that is babysitting the cleaning process while at home. There is a spot cleaning function on the 880 that I have also used every day, this feature defiantly requires babysitting because once you have pushed the spot button it only runs for 2 minutes in a circle pattern, if it didn't clean well say on 2 area rugs, which on mine it is not doing a great job at cleaning, so mine must be a type of pile area rug butÊ you can push the spot button every 2 minutes for over 2 hours, this makes my area rugs look better because it sort of fluffs the nap up but when you get down close you see all the pet hair that is just can not pull out of the rug. If these area rugs were new I would be upset with all the 880 doesn't pick off of them. On my hard floors I love it, it seems to take a couple cleanings before it learns the rooms, then it doesn't leave kitty litter behind, lovin that. I can walk around bare foot now!! To clean more rooms after the 880 has cleaned the first 4 at my home and docked itself to recharge I have to wait approx., an hour for it to recharge fully, then I carry it to those rooms and since there is know carpet or area rugs in those rooms it does a really good job and I usually turn it off an take back to its home base and it will still have a battery left to run. There is still 2 rooms in my home that I have not used it on and that's because I get tired of babysitting and organizing the rooms, but I would say to clean all of the house it would take the first original full charge, then the second recharge and may be not complete the entire house on that second recharge. The lighthouses that come with the 880 are a big help if you want it to focus on just one or two rooms and not enter the other rooms or you can close the doors to those rooms if they have doors. I need to say if you are using the spot cleaning function on the 880 and you don't want to bend over every 2 min's., then you will love having the included remote. When I have pushed the Dock button on the 880 itself it takes a bit for it to look like it is heading home, when it docks itself for recharging it seems to not be confused in heading in the right direction. In the books that come with it and the videos that you will receive via emails it tells you to clean all these parts every 3 months if you have pets, we had to do so either the second or third day of use. It is an easy cleaning process though. I have to dump the bin VERY frequently do to being an animal lover so I have a feeling these parts will have to be cleaned a lot more often then every 3 months. As long as this machine keeps working I plan to keep using, and for me that will be almost every day. I sent a message to iRobot to ask about an extended warranty they do not offer one. I can not scroll back up here to reread my review so hope my spelling is ok. I hope to post again about the 880 when I have had it longer also."
05/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Loved it so much I got one for my parents too!,"I have had the 880 for a couple of weeks and feel compelled to give a review. I had toyed with the idea of a robot vacuum for a long time but could not stomach the idea of paying so much for a ""robot vacuum.""Ê With not enough hours in the day, three kids, two dogs, a cat and husband, the ever-growing tumbleweed of fur, dust and crumbs taunted me. When I saw that the 880 was discounted for Mother's Day, I decided to give it a try. It so easy to use and does such an incredible job, I have now also gotten my elderly parents one as well.The key to appreciating this vacuum, like most things, is to manage your expectations. This will not replace your regular vacuum. If you have stairs, it cannot climb them, it does not dust raised wood trim or woodwork, it will not clean the deeper parts of rugs that are textured to the point of having very high and low portions (think ""dirt trapper"" rugs typically used in mudroom entries). It cannot clean an entire, large house on one charge and it sometimes will get its edge wedged under a dresser or chest that is juuuussst the wrong height, and not be able to extricate itself. What it will do is very effectively clean a variety of surfaces on an impressive battery charge, with little user intervention required.I have hardwoods, thin area carpets, thick/wool area rugs (with texture/varying heights), thick and thin Persian and Turkish rugs (with fringe) atop hardwoods and carpet, travertine and tile floors. (The rugs vary in color and I have had no issue with the 880's sensor not allowing it to clean even very dark blue orientals.) The 880 has impressively moved from one surface to the other and cleaned them all (with the exception of the low parts of a mudroom ""dirt trapper"" rug).Ê I have removed small bathroom throw-rugs with no rubberized backing, figuring they would be scooted out of the way. I have also swept mess off my stairs onto the floor below, allowing Roomba to indirectly clean my stairs. I have a dresser that is just the height that allows the edge of Roomba to scoot beneath, and get stuck. It chimes an error and will shut itself down if not rescued. I could use the virtual lighthouses to block this off, but I haven't bothered -- I just don't run the machine in that room unless I am nearby and able to rescue Roomba when needed.As for the virtual lighthouses (2 included)Ê -- I was not sure how they were different from the virtual walls I saw on other models.Ê There are two settings on the virtual lighthouse. When set to lighthouse, the box signals Roomba to keep coming toward it, and beyond, when the current area is clean. When set to wall, the box signals Roomba to not go past that point. You can team the two lighthouses included to create a ""halo"" to protect area in a more circular way, if needed. I have a large house with a lot of doors and am able to keep Roomba in one area for a thorough clean (it shuts itself down when it determines an area is fully cleaned) without using these devices. Without them, and an open doorway, I am not sure how far Roomba would travel, but it likely would not be able to find its way back to the dock to recharge.It will automatically return to the dock to recharge itself -- just place the dock against a wall with fairly good clearance on the remaining 3 sides. (Dock must be kept plugged in, so near an outlet as well).Ê The dock itself is about 5 1/4""x 5 3/4"" and with the Roomba docked it's 15 1/4"" x 13 1/4"". The lighthouse boxes are battery powered and turn on and off automatically as the Roomba is powered up or off. I have not timed it, but I estimate that the Roomba takes about 2 hours to fully charge, and runs about the same before needing a charge. The dust bin is small-ish, but it holds an astonishing amount. There is a red trash bin signal displayed on top of Roomba when the bin needs emptying. Emptying the bin only requires you to push a release button on top of the Roomba and slide the bin out, fold down theÊ bon ""door"" and shake debris into your trash container. There is a little hepa filter atop the dust bin (Roomba comes with 2) with its own door. With a pull on the yellow tab, remove the filter, tap it against the inside of your trash can to clean, reseat the filter and slide the dust bin back into Roomba -- one press of th big round ""Clean"" button atop the Roomba and its back on its way. Once your floors are being regularly cleaned, you will not have to empty the bin as often, but at the beginning, you will have to empty more often -- because the Roomba is hard at work cleaning up the long-neglected mess!!I have lots of cords and wires, carpet fringe and toys, stuffed animals, etc... around the house. Roomba has had no trouble. A few times, I have seen the ""working to not tangle"" warning light on top of the Roomba when running atop cords. Also, when Roomba senses a very dirty area, a blue magnifying glass warning lights and the Roomba will go back and forth over the area until it determines it is clean. There are manual buttons atop the machine -- dock (sends Roomba home to the dock), spot (Roomba will quickly spot clean a small circular area - perfect for spills), and time setting buttons for programming. It is all very user friendly and straightforward. This machine is clearly made to be user-friendly, all parts ""below"" that need tending or are removable are yellow or indicated by yellow parts. Aside from dumping the bin and tapping the hepa filter (btw, right now. when you register the machine online, irobot will send you two free hepa filters), you need to clean the ends of the extricator bars now and then -- there will be a collection of hair on each end, typically. But even those have two different patterns and if you are not sure how to correctly replace them, just look at the pattern pictures on the vac itself -- the pictures show you exactly which goes where and even which direction they must face. (To testify to ease of use, I did just buy one for my elderly parents -- knowing full well that *I* would be getting tech support calls over the slightest area of concern or confusion. As anticiapted, I have gotten no help calls, and they have been using it a lot.)Note that there is also a remote control provided with this unit.Ê I have had no use for mine, though the kids have enjoyed bossing Roomba around a bit with with. It allows you to power Roomba on and off, manually direct Roomba, select spot clean, or tell it to go to its home dock.Apologies for the long review, but this is a splurge for most people and as someone who offen has ""analysis paralysis"" before making a large purchase, I value details. Is it perfect, flawless and will clean the entire house top to bottom, and all on one charge? No. But is does a remarkable job. Because my house is multi-levels and large, I have run it every day for weeks now in different places and it is remarkable. There are no more tumbleweed balls, no more wispy patches of pet hair, and even under the beds are now clean."

Then I find out it won't vacuum my rugs. It goes onto my rugs fine, gets confused and gives me an error message. I have read in other reviews that it won't vacuum black rugs and that's what I have. Ugg, what a ridiculous issue to have. I will be putting tape over the sensors on the bottom to see if that helps. The machine thinks the black rugs are the edge of stairs or something.Also, don't even try to figure out what it's doing.....it just makes no sense. The robot vacuum is just for cleaning in between your normal vacuuming schedule. It leaves entire sections un vacuumed! It is too expensive to be so random and won't clean my rugs."

4/28/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Best Roomba yet,"I have been using the Roomba 500 pet vacuum for two years and was completely satisfied until I used this model.Ê It is definitely more powerful and efficient.Ê The new system replaces the brushes and its a considerable improvement.Ê My carpets are much brighter and cleaner than with the 500 unit.Ê In fact I had just ran the 500 and then followed with the 880 and I was amazed that the dust bin was almost full...as the rug looked clean before.Ê I also noticed it is considerably more quiet than the older model.Ê Additionally, it does not slam into walls and furniture as hard as the older model.Ê It is pricey but if your looking for high quality and super clean floors this is the model to choose.Ê Overall impressive"
01/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,No more sweeping floors!!! iRobot is great!,"I have been looking at iRobot for the past 5 years, trying to figure out if it was worth the price to have a robot vacuum my floors - now that I have one, I don't regret it at all!Ê We live in the Caribbean in a large home with all ceramic floors and a new black lab - the amount of dust and dirt that was tracked in everyday increased 100% when we brought in our new puppy - which is what pushed me to finally purchase.I really appreciate how easily the iRobot is to work - the controls are easy to follow and the dirt is easy to empty.Ê I have had to find a few online tutorials, but all in all, the iRobot is very intuitive.Ê At first I didn't realize that the bin that collects the dirt actually lifted down to release the dirt easier, and I was trying to shake it out through the slot that captures the dirt.Ê Once I figured this out, it's been very easy to keep maintenance on.Ê A tip that I didn't read anywhere else, is that anything that is manufactured in YELLOW on the iRobot is a piece that moves or can be removed to facilitate maintenance.I use the iRobot everyday and am continually amazed at how much dirt is picks up - the 2 virtual walls/lighthouses are very easy to use and helpful for the large space downstairs - keeping it contained in the kitchen or dining area, before it moves on to the living area.Ê These devices use 2 ""C"" batteries, and I've had to change them once in 3 months, so they seem to get a decent life span, with everyday use.The iRobot picks up dog hair, my daughter's waist-long hair and dirt easily.Ê It smooths over computer cords, and if by chance gets caught up, tries to release itself.Ê If release is not possible, it turns itself off.Ê My refrigerator is almost the exact height as the iRobot, so I have had to place a small, rolled up throw carpet under it, so that the iRobot doesn't get stuck - everything else it is the perfect height to glide underneath or just get to the edges (under cabinets, mainly).Ê I love that there are no more hiding dust bunnies under the beds upstairs.So many good things to say about this product.Ê I am glad that I waited a while to purchase, because I feel like the technology has had time to be refined from when it first came out - if you are tired of sweeping your floors, BUY THIS PRODUCT.Ê You won't regret it!"
12/15/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Amazing. Way better than previous models for dog hair.,"I have an especially fuzzy Golden Retriever and my old Roomba's bristle brush would constantly get clogged with hair. Hair would also wrap around the brush and wheel bearings making it a pain to clean. I gave up on the Roomba when it started taking more time to clean it than it did to vacuum the house myself. I was initially skeptical about the new 880 model but decided to give it a try. I was absolutely amazed how much better it is compared to the old version.Ê I have it run every day in my living room, bedroom and kitchen and it does a great job of keeping up with all of the dog hair. There is so much hair in the bin that sometimes I wonder if the Roomba is running right over the back of my sleeping dog. (It's not. My dog doesn't let it come close to her.) I highly recommend this new model."
05/08/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Virtual wall sensors failed after only two months of service!,"I have an earlier version and it's still going.Ê The 880 works wonderfully, however the virtual wall sensor device (came with two) has stopped working.Ê At first I thought it was the batteries, but that was not the case.Ê I dislike the fact that I had to replace these two sensors after only two months of service!"

09/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Best six hundred dollars I ever spent.,"I have a half great pyrenees, half husky dog that sheds like the world is ending.Ê I got a roomba hoping it'd help reduce the amount I needed to sweep, but expecting it to be more or less a novelty item.I haven't had to sweep or vacuum since I bought it, which admittedly hasn't been that long ago, but since my floors (and rugs!) are getting cleaner, rather than less clean, over time, I don't expect this to change.Much to my surprise (having had a roomba many years ago that was essentially a stupid bumper car), the 880 navigates complex rooms with ease.Ê It even avoids squeezing under things that look ""a bit too tight.""Ê Error lights are easy to interpret and problems are ridiculously easy to sort out on the rare occasion that they do occur (generally they're my fault when they do at all).Ê The wall/object sensor is brilliant, it's so gentle when it bumps off objects that even unstable ceiling fans barely wiggle when it taps them.Ê The vacuum somehow manages to suck up ingrained dirt and pet fur, but if there's an odd wire lying on the floor it won't suck it up and choke on it.Ê The pathing is extremely intelligent and the brush thingy does a surprisingly good job of clearing out corners.Ê It also pulverizes dust bunnies, making them easier to collect, the collection of which was an unanticipated side benefit, as apparently the roomba can gleefully navigate the complex spaces under my desk without any help whatsoever, even while I'm sitting at it in my chair.The only thing that doesn't quite work is the docking, the code underlying how it 'adjusts' if it misses the dock a little is really silly, I suspect the code was tested on a dock somewhat more securely fastened than the lightweight portable dock it comes with... but this ""problem"" is easily resolved with duct tape (to fasten the dock to something) or, as it turns out, a little code tweaking of my own, as the roomba (somewhat to my surprise) came sealed with a little sticker that says ""if you're a software developer of some sort, feel free to add functionalities to the code.""So yeah.Ê My floors are spotless in spite of my heavy-shedding pet, which I accomplish by sitting with a good book and a beer.Ê Once every couple of days, I take out the back of the roomba and shake it lightly into a bin to empty it, and then I go back to my beer.Would buy again.Ê Might actually buy an extra and program it to follow me around carrying a six pack, just for fun.Ê The battery lasts for freakin' ever, too."

7/19/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Excellent product. Very pleased.,"I have 4 shedding animals in my household, 2 of which I am allergic to.Ê I vacillated for many months before taking the plunge and buying the Roomba.Ê This was a terrific purchase.Ê It vacuums the floors every morning before I get up and my allergies have all but disappeared.Ê PLUS, I have clean floors all the time.Ê My advice to anyone with pet shedding issues:Ê buy one."
4/21/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Best thing I ever purchased!,I have 4 kids and a 7000 square foot house. Cleaning is a full time job! I love everything about the ROOMBA 880! It's not too loud and I can set it to clean while I'm out. What more could I ask for??? My floors look great and it even cleans under my beds and couches! Amazing!!!! Everyone should own one. Worth every penny!
06/02/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,great for 2 shedding pugs!,"I have 2 pugs. This baby does the job...I run it at 11:30pm on Mon, Wed, Fri. Really an amazing product!"
06/09/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great compared to older models,"I had the 564 pet series which was a great addition to the family. But after having to replace the brushes multiple times and cleaning it was a nightmare we decided to go with the newer model.(We have two dogs)Ê This is a breath of fresh air.Ê It isn't as loud as the 564 and the brushes are super easy to clean, if you need to. A nice added feature is the red bin light when it needs to be emptied.Ê Everything else is pretty much the same as the 564 except this one also comes with a remote.Ê The remote is a little different to use but is nice when you want to clean a certain spot.Ê I would recommend this product.Ê You can tell a huge difference on carpet and does great on wood floors."
5/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,Gets stuck under something almost every day.,"I had such high hopes for this after all the positive reviews.Ê Unfortunately the roomba gets stuck under the lower edges of cabinets under my sink and under my island in the kitchen.Ê Then it gets stuck under the edges of my couch.Ê In the last six months it has completed a fully cleaning 3 times without me having to dislodge it from something.Ê I can't leave it running unattended, as it has destroyed its rubber tracks trying to free itself over and over."
1/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,A huge improvement over the early models.,"I had one of the original Roombas and it worked fairly well for a while before it finally quit.Ê This one seems a lot better, partly because it can be scheduled to clean automatically, and also because it is much more reliable.Ê It doesn't get tangled up in loose cords, and it handles changing surfaces much better than the old one did.Ê It still occasionally gets stuck, though not nearly as often.The first few times it got huge amounts of dust and fluff out of the carpets: now it seem to get only a moderate amount.Ê After a couple of weeks, the carpets look almost new again!iRobot appears to have fixed the problems the earlier models had, and it 's difficult to see how they could do much better than this."
07/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Pretty Amazing,"I had no idea how good this thing worked.Ê It cleans the entire ground floor of our house relentlessly (kitchen, dining room, breakfast area, family room, office, bedroom, master bath with two closets, guest bath) , and collects under furniture where we had great difficulty reaching.Ê I was a bit confused on how to use the two lighthouses but finally got them configured in the correct places.Ê iRobot has a video on how to place them if you use them in that mode versus an ""invisible wall.""Ê Here is the link:Ê https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_qayCFzg-I"
10/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Essential for anyone with shedding dogs,"I had never really thought of getting one of these until 2 colleagues who own dogs swore by it, so I bit the bullet and I have becoem an instant advocate for Roomba. This little machine is awesome. Sure it doesnt have a large dirt container like a fullsize vacuum but it operates flawlessly and I am amazed at how much 'hidden' dog hair and dirt it picks up. I set it up to alternate different parts of the house every other night and I'm learning how to use the 'virtual wall'devices to prevent it getting stuck in some tight places. This is a fantastic product!"
1/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,"Pricy with subpar service and warranty, think twice before you buy it!","I had bought this in April, 2014, I have been using it in my 2nd floor master bedroom since, I had it set up on schedule every weekday while nobody was at home, it worked ok, once in a while I would find it somewhere on the floor nowhere near the base, so I had to pick it up and put it back, the next time it would work fine again.However the problem became more persistent starting from two weeks ago, it happened everyday for 10 days in a row, so I decided to call this company and tried to get this issue resolved, the 1st time I called, I was asked a whole bunch of questions that gave me the impression that they were trying to deny there was such a problem, there was question about the location of the home base, the distance between the home base and the virtual wall, blah, blah, blah, and this lady told me that I had to watch Roomba while it's working and see if there's any error message that might indicate what the problem is, so that's what I did on Sat. an Sun., the same thing happened, no error message given. So I called them again on Monday, after 20-min's hold time, I was only to be told to run more tests, that's when I said enough is enough and asked to be transferred to a supervisor. Well, she came on and offered more trouble shooting tips and kept me on the floor trying different things to no avail for half an hour, finally she gave up and said they would send me a replacement without a battery or any other accessories. After the hour-long phone call, I received an email from them stating that there's no warranty for the replacement after the original warranty runs out, which from my understanding is you get this piece of junk for $700, after that, you will be out of luck. I will never buy anything from this company again."
11/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Excellent Product,"I had been waiting for years to purchase this product.Ê I struggled over the cost and how well it would perform in my home.Ê Now I cannot imagine life without it.I watched many videos on this product and one reviewer recommended moving things, example: putting your chairs up so it can easily get under the kitchen or dining room tables.Ê I took all the advice from reviewers and each Saturday morning, I put everything up, chairs, dog crates, recycle bin etc. and let it do it's thing.Ê I live in the south west and have saltillo tile in my living room, galley kitchen and kitchen table area.Ê It is about 780 square feet.Ê The Roomba 880 takes about 1 hour to complete the entire area.Ê We used the vitual walls to block off the entrance ways going into the family room and another hallway on the other side of the house.Ê We close any doors and lift the window curtains and shears so they are not touching the floor.Ê One time it pulled down a window shear but stopped immediately.Ê Now we just put the them up using the side curtain holders on the wall.Ê I have to say, we have curtains that do rest on the floor, like they fan out at the bottom.Ê It sounds like a lot of work, but now I have such a system that it is easy.Ê I run it early morning.Ê Let it recharge and run it again late morning.Ê I mop and then put things back in place for the rest of the weekend and week.I have two small dogs and honestly the majority of the items collected in the bin is dog fur.Ê My floors look amazing and it is one of the things guests comment on when visiting our home on how beautiful the floors are.I had initially thought I would run it every day, but I found that to run it on Saturday (twice) is perfect for our life style.Ê I always want to be home when it is running.Ê It one time got caught under the dishwasher edge and one time under by husband's recliner.Ê Now I just open the recliner, so the foot rest is extended and it solved that problem.Ê It has never again got caught under the dishwasher.My husband and I are very frugal so it was hard to spend the money, but I have to say I am very happy with the roomba and my only regret is not buying it sooner.Ê Highly recommend."
08/01/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,This model is amazing. It cleans really well and hasn't gotten stuck ...,"I had an old Roomba (500 series) and it was a piece of junk.Ê I rarely used it since it got stuck every 2 minutes and didn't clean much. I was a little apprehensive about spending so much money on the new model, but with a new house, 2 cats, and hardwood floors that are always covered with cat litter, I decided I needed a little help keeping my house clean.Ê This model is amazing.Ê It cleans really well and hasn't gotten stuck on rugs or anything. I'm really glad I bought it and am going to buy a second one for the upstairs floor."
9/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,I had already owned a Roomba 760 which we liked very much,"I had already owned a Roomba 760 which we liked very much. But then it started cleaning only a few feet before stopping. Eventually I was able to fixed this by cleaning the window under the rollers.Meanwhile, I ordered a Roomba 880 which has 50% more cleaning power. Unfortunately, I own a double-coated dog who sheds 3X per year. This new Roomba requires frequent maintenance because it plugs frequently. It looks to me that iRobot got the better cleaning efficiently simply by making the openings smaller & thus increasing the face velocity. This is a classic approach.Yesterday I had to raise the level of our couch with 3 felt pads & a felt coaster because both our Roombas seem programmed to head directly for the coach in order to get stuck underneath.Ê Still we are satisfied with both. Both are running now nicely cleaning our long ranch styled house."
04/10/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I am in love!,"I had a Roomba many years ago when they first came out.Ê I was rather underwhelmed.Ê It was loud, held very little dirt, got stuck often, and seemed to barely clean.Ê I handed it 'down' to my mother who also rejected it.Ê It sat unused on a lonely shelf until it made it's way to a yard sale.Ê That Roomba was a novelty.This Roomba is a masterpiece.Ê Or at least the sonnet that I'm going to compose to it will be.Ê I have carpet in two bedrooms and the rest of the house is hardwood or linoleum.Ê First the carpets - holy cow, I had no idea they were that dirty!Ê The Roomba gets out dirt my full-size vacuum cleaner misses.Ê I set it out to clean my bedroom and it filled up with dirt before it finished.Ê The amount of dirt and dust was astonishing.Ê I started it again, this time it filled up with dirt but it did finish.Ê The third time it cleaned the entire bedroom, bathroom, and walk-in closet and was only half full.Ê I started running it every other day and it never fills up that way.Ê My Roomba cleans my carpets while I'm at work, or walking the dog, or even lying on the couch stuffing my face with potato chips.My Roomba has vacuumed my floor while my kids sleep in the room next door.Ê The loudest noise is when it bumps into a door during it's navigation.Ê It has only ever gotten stuck once which is under a particular dresser with a high side but a low front.Ê I use the virtual walls to keep the Roomba out from under that dresser.Ê If the Roomba finds a lot of dirt, it goes over the spot a few times to make sure it's clean.Ê My carpeted rooms have never looked so nice or been so clean.Ê My kids' babysitter told me the carpeting looks brand new - which is saying something in a kids room!While the vacuum is insanely great on carpets, I'm a little less pleased on the hardwoods.Ê Not that I'm unhappy, I'm just not jumping over the moon there.Ê While it does vacuum a lot of dirt on the hardwood, it also seems to miss some spots.Ê It may be that there is too much stuff on the floor - we are packing up the apartment to list it for sale. That makes it hard for the Roomba to navigate.Ê I've only tried that room once but will update my review after trying it a few more times.Ê It is a little louder when vacuuming hardwood as the carpet isn't muffling its sound.It does a good job on the linoleum.Ê However, I have a few deep pile rugs on the bathroom floor.Ê One is long and narrow and the Roomba has a little trouble climbing up on it.Ê After a few runs, I just started picking that rug up.Ê The smaller rug though is fine.Ê It does a great job on the kitchen floor.My floors have never been so clean and with so little effort.Ê I come home to clean floors and the Roomba parked back on it's charger.Ê Sigh...Edit (4/11/14):Yesterday I got two additional lighthouse/virtual walls and now the Roomba cleans my room, my kids room, and both bathrooms before it quietly returns to it's dock and waits for my next command.Ê I wish my dog and kids behaved like that.Warning!!Ê Once you buy a Roomba, you'll start thinking, 'Maybe I need more robots.Ê Maybe I should have one mop my floor...'Ê My Braava arrived yesterday and is mopping my kitchen floor now."
6/13/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Way ahead of 770 so far time will tell if it should get 5 stars,"I had a 770 for about a month, (bought from Best Buy). It kept getting stuck on my patterened rug - tan with some black swirly stripes. It thought it was going off a cliff. I read some reviews on the 880 and decided to return the 770 and try the 880. It has only been a few hours and I am already impressed. The 880 moves faster, is a little quieter (not much, but a little), seems smarter about navigating around furniture, and moves over our area rug much better. It did get stuck once so far, but the 770 got stuck everytime it was on this rug. The bin full light also seems to work on the 880, its come on three times already, whereas the 770 it never came on, even though it was definately full. I have all hardwood, with three area rugs. Two very low tight profile rugs, and one medium pile rug with the dark stripes. So far I am very impressed with the 880 over the 770. And I have two dogs that shed like mad. A corgi and a shephard/hound mix. I dont review often, so I am really impressed. If it holds up well over time, it will deserve 5 stars."
6/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Benefits outweigh the cost. Better than the 770 model,"I had 770 for a year and upgraded to 880 a month ago in May 2014. Let me do a comparison review, about performance and cost.1. Cost: The 880 model costs $200 more that 770. It is no small money. But if you are ready to invest $400 or more on a vacuum cleaner, then like me you are probably ready to spare the extra 200 provided there are significant incremental benefits. But $700 was still high. So I went to Bed Bath and Beyond with their 20% off coupon for new email customers and got this baby for $560. Now that cost is a little bit reasonable, lets talk performance.2. Battery: On the initial days the 880 battery sucked. It barely lasted an hour. But by 2nd week, the battery started lasting much longer. I have seen it doing 2-3 hour long cleaning sessions. The 770 by comparison lasted about a couple of hours on the best days.3. Cleaning power/ suction: I am reasonably impressed with the 880. This one has a wider mouth to suck objects big enough as caps of water bottles, facial tissue, whole candies, and alphabets that kids play with. Its limit was tested when it sucked in an A4 size paper folded in 4. It didn't stop or issue warning, but continued with a weird sound. The 770 model is significantly behind in this respect. I have seen 770 suck in paper clips , but bigger or longer things like facial tissue stops it. However the bigger mouth and bigger ego of 880 cause it to suck the area rugs in and get in trouble. 770 seemed to ignore a lot of things mightier than paper clips, including area rugs, which was good and bad.4. Navigation: After running clueless in the initial days, 880 seem to have figured things out. A handful of times, it got stuck behind doors, pushed the door to close and got stuck in the room. Other times it came out of rooms just fine.It seem to work around other objects just fine. The 770 used to always lock itself in the restrooms. The 770 also used to climb on to other objects like bags, or some thing else and stop. The 880 seem to tackle the same hurdles better. However the 880 seem to have some issue finding its base at the end of the cleaning. No big deal since the cleaning is already done.5. Routine Maintenance: I find it easy to clean 880. The trash bin is big enough. The whole suction canal is also big enough to clean.The HEPA filter is bigger than 770. The cleaning brushes are not made of rubbery material and does not get hairs entangled in them.Some hairs get circled at the either ends of the brushes but they come out with a pull. All in all it takes a minute or two to clean the 880 trash can, brushes, HEPA filter and canal. The 770 is also easy but takes a little longer because the brushes spins hair in its bristles and one needs to cut the hair out. The trash can also seemed small and dirtier compared to 880.6. Overall cleaning effectiveness: For electronics, some times the whole is lesser than the sum of the parts. But 880 seem to add up well. It seem to clean all the places, hardwood and carpet, well enough. Unlike 770 which some times push or blow away some trash and dust, 880 seems to pull them all and suck em in.7. Other usable features: Both 880 and 770 has hifi features like automatic timed cleaning etc. I don't use those features. I find it fairly easy to just press its button. But if some one is interested to know more, let me know and I will test it and tell you.8. Sound: 880 is pretty quiet. A hum. 770 was a little louder but not like handheld vacuums. I may not sleep with a 770 running, but with a 880, I probably may, as long as it does not hit a lot of objects.9. Overall build quality: Both seem well built and sturdy. I have used 880 only for a month, so I cannot speak for the long term durability. I will update after a year. But it looks as sturdy as 770. 770 was sturdy enough to survive the million times it hit the walls and other objects. it also survived the torture of my 2 year old who used to step on it, throw his shoes on it, push his big toy truck against it. At the end of the year the small round sensor came off the head of the 770. It still hanged there and helped roomba get around. But it looked like the eyes of aliens, hanging out.Over all, the extra benefits are of value worth $50 - $100 extra. But I spent more than that because I have allergies and 770 was not cleaning that well enough. The BedBath deal made it work for me. I have not had buyers remorse with either model, because when i get home and see the beautiful vacuum tracks left by roomba, every day, i feel good. Besides I don't have to fight with my wife on who does the vacuum that weekend, or whether i did it properly. An investment that provides daily returns, I would buy a roomba and gladly skip a vacation to compensate."

10/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,The vacuum is great. iRobot is too caught up in itw own image to make it work great,"I got this before I was to have surgery because I knew that I couldn't do much for a few weeks post surgery. I have a dog. It's dusty around here.I have this set to go vacuum up the lower part of my house every other day.Ê That's well more than 3K sq ft. It does a magnificent job. iRobot has little electronic pods that work with the unit. you can set them to either attract or repel the Roomba... I bought extras. there are a few placecs that I don't want this thing to go... like under the range in the kitchen. The Roomba needs to have some user adjustable ""finders"" to prohibit it from going under such things. I did this think stuck under the couch or such pretty much every day. The pods need to be much smaller.. So while all of these is inconvenient on a daily basis... the vacuum does a great job. and because it goes out every other day, the table top dust is way down too. But you have to be home when it's vacuuming because it can't complete on it's own."
07/05/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,I'm very glad I bought this.,"I got this at the beginning of May and I use it on my ~2000 sq ft home once/week.I really like this device.Ê I have saltillo tile floors with a fairly wide grouting in most of the house. I have smaller tiles in both bathrooms and carpeting in the master bd and a loft space.I was concerned that the unevenness of the height of the saltillo tiles and grouting, along with the fact that this model doesn't have any brushes (except for the side brush), would prevent this unit from being effective.Ê While it's certainly not perfect, it does a really good job and I am very happy with it.The rollers of course get dirty, but they are very easy to remove and clean.Ê A little hot soapy water and a sponge to wipe them down do the job nicely.Ê Same with the side brush.Ê Unscrew it and a little hot soapy water and it's clean again too.Ê Of course the rollers should be completely dry before putting them back in.It also does a good job on my carpeting.Ê Occasionally threads get wrapped up on the rollers, but they're easy to pull off while washing them.When using in the carpeted rooms, I usually have to empty the canister once in the middle of the job, or cordon off the room into 2 segments using the lighthouse (which work very well).It navigates around obstacles well, but I still remove a few things to facilitate cleaning.Ê It doesn't handle small, low, lightweight rugs well.Ê It pushes them rather than gets on top of, so those are one of the few things I remove.The hepa filter is very nice and works very well.Ê It works so well I had to clean it multiple times during the initial runs.Ê Buy yourself several cans of compressed air and after each run, remove the filter and blow it out clean (outside).Ê I bought replacement filters too, and after a number of runs with the first filter I replaced it with a fresh one and washed and dried the first.Ê I'll now reuse the first one when it's time to wash the current one.Issues:It has some issues reconnecting itself.Ê My home is on several levels, so I never program this to run on it's own.Ê I carry it to a part of the house to clean and when it's finished, I carry it back to the charging station.Ê I've tried putting it on the floor in front of the charger and press the Dock button.Ê Sometimes it makes it, but it usually takes 4 or 5 attempts. I don't usually bother any more and I just place it on the charger myself.Unless the top of your stairs are well illuminated, it may get stuck there.Ê It will go a little too far over the edge, get stuck and call out for help.Ê I've found turning on a light prevents this from happening."
5/25/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Gets the job done.,"I got the Roomba on the premise that it would not be a substitute for a thorough Swifter job done by me, but figured it would keep down the amount of daily dog and cat hair and small ""pillows"" of hair that would find their way to the baseboards around the house. I used to run around with my handheld vac once or twice a day (I work from home) in between days that I actually broke out the Swifter, but I have a 4,500 sq foot house, so it's a back breaker.Needless to say, I've been eyeing these robots for over a year and have compared them with all of the geek magazine reviews and so on (as I don't trust the Amazon reviews because I think most are hired writers), and I have to see that I have been pleasantly surprised. I actually love this thing. I have had it for about three weeks and I think I've used the Swifter twice. Now, if it strays too far, it won't make it back to the base, but that's only because I don't set up the virtual wall because it almost always makes it back. It goes for hours and does most of the bottom floor (approx. 3,000 sq ft.). I have to let it re-charge to take it upstairs, which I may do a few times a week. I must mention that we have all tile and wood floors with very low lying area rugs. I have one high shag upstairs that it doesn't go on, but I don't care, it goes under the beds, which is more than I do!After spending almost $100K on Amazon and constantly thinking that I need to go on an review this or that product, this is actually my first review. I am also going to review the IScooba which I bought at the same time and I am returning. I read the reviews and was ready to accept that it was less than perfect as long as it took daily scuff marks and dog prints away until I could get to do a thorough mopping job on the weekend, but it's performance didn't justify it's price by any means."
12/30/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Beware of tile floors,"I got the 880 for Christmas and was overjoyed at the prospect of using it on my kitchen tile floor.Ê Bummer, it doesn't pick up any dirt or particles in the grout lines.Ê Now I don't know if it's worth the price at all.Ê The tile floor needs done much more often than the carpeted areas.Ê Very disappointed."
11/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,100% maintenance-free after 500 uses,"I got my first Roomba in 2004 and was mostly unimpressed.Ê I have no idea what I ever did with it, but didn't use it much.It took me until mid-2014 - a full 10 years - to give Roomba another chance.Ê Well, I've had the 880 for over 16 months and it is still going strong after ~ 500 nightly runs.Ê I have never had to do any maintenance.Ê Never had to change anything or fix anything.Ê No brushes or filters to clean, which I know you have to do for the less expensive models.Ê The 880 has exceeded any hope I ever had for it.Ê If you are thinking about the 880 vs 780 or any other model below it, I can't praise the maintenance-free nature of the 880 enough.Of course I have to empty the dustbin (when the light tells me to - definitely not every day), and occasionally I find Roomba, like a lost child, under my couch caught on my daughter's dress-up Elsa wig, but this is nothing.Ê I'm really thrilled with my Roomba.Ê I'm actually here writing a review because I'm considering buying a second one for the top floor.Ê Given that this has run for 500 nights without showing ANY signs of age or wear-and-tear - I imagine it's easily got another 500 runs in it. That comes to perhaps 50-cents per run.Ê Certainly far more than worth it, and for me, worth getting one for each floor of the house."
5/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,A suicidal robot!,"I got a suicidal one!Ê It keeps on jamming itself under the cabinet that's just high enough for this Roomba to not trigger its sensors, but clearly not high enough for it stop itself from getting jammed or to figure out it should stop trying to go there if at first it doesn't succeed. Poor thing kills itself nightly... ;)P.S. Careful when buying from Amazon directly, as they will charge you the tax - although they're advertising themselves as the least expensive seller. Other sellers might not charge the tax, so they'll be less expensive!"

Very little effort on behalf of the operator.Ê I love it!
7/31/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Spectacular!,"I get my house cleaned weekly, and I can't believe the amount of dust and debris Reggie the Roomba sucks out of the carpets. Also does great job on hardwoods, tile and navigates under my furniture like a champ! I'm in love."
05/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Very effective,"I gave this to my wife for mothers day.Ê We have 3 dogs and 3 cats and hair is a major issue.Ê Also, the dogs bring in debris from the yard.Ê This little guy did a great!! job.Ê Ran the first time for 2 hour and 20 minutes.Ê My wife commented that it looked as good as when she did it.Don't get me wrong we will still need to vacuum once and a while but this does the day to day maintenance so the house always looks clean."

Of course the 980 is too of the line tech with all its camera and mapping abilities that work wonders. If you would like the cleaning of the 980 without the crazy price tag. This would be the way to do it. While not as advanced it does clean well.

9/15/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,I expected more from this robot.,"I expected more out of this product.Ê I guess robotics aren't yet where I expected them to be.Ê I purchased this for a multi-room house with very large rooms.Ê Most is carpet.Ê Apparently, the rooms are too large.Ê The unit frequently stops in the middle of the room and can't make it back to the charger unit.Ê I use the light houses to help modulate the size of the cleaning area, but it still fails to coax the unit back for self charging.Ê The dust bin is small and needs to be cleaned too often.Ê I must stick something into the dust bin in order to get the bin to properly empty.Ê This is dusty and dirty work.Ê They should find a better way to manage this.Ê Also, after only two months of partial use, the unit broke down and I had to request various parts to be sent out so that I can replace them.Ê Have received the parts, but not yet had the time to break out the instructions and make the needed repairs.Ê Hopefully, after the warranty expires this will not continue to break down on me.Ê Conclusion:Ê for what this unit cost, I expected more out of it and I expected better reliability.Ê I do like the product or at least the idea behind it, but I am disappointed.Ê I want to give this 2.5 stars, but since I cannot, I will give it only 2 stars.Ê If given the opportunity, I would return it and consider buying one of their less expensive units."
11/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Not quite the future,"I expected complete cleaning automation for the price point. Instead I find it much easier to clean manually.The good: - Picks up dirt, dust, and hair well (rather impressed with how well it works considering it's size) - Fire and forget cleaning (as advertised, sorta) - Remote control (can turn cleaning into a game, great for annoying the cats) - Scheduled cleaning sessions (neat feature) - Virtual walls (nice to have to prevent it from going to certain areas)The bad: - Easily gets stuck (under fridge, on lamp base, on cat furniture) - High maintenance (hair wraps around spinning brush, Roomba errors off, I have to use screwdriver to remove brush to remove hair..... almost every cleaning session) - Chair legs are Roomba's nemesis (dinning room chairs and bar stools are a big obstacle. Once inside the chair legs, it has a difficult time getting out. I usually have to move the chairs out of the way so Roomba can properly clean those areas)"
08/09/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,works great.,"I even named her, works great."
01/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,I don't understand the good reviews on this product,"I don't understand the good reviews on this product.Ê I based my decision to purchase the Roomba 880 based on the reviews on Amazon.Ê Needless to say we were extremely disappointed in its performance.Ê It didn't pickup minor items on the floor, nor did it completely cover the entire room."
1/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,LOVE our Jarvis!,"I don't normally leave reviews but my Jarvis is just too amazing. I don't know what I did before he came into my life. Our house was a zoo before Jarvis, but now things are much more manageable. You'll be surprised how much dirt, fur, and hair roombas pick up. We found out that he'll even suck up crayons. He is the first roomba we bought so I don't have anything else to compare it to besides our Dyson. There is a curious side effect that you want to clean more. Similar to having to pick up for a cleaning service before they come to your house. We do make sure to put up the dining room chairs so he doesn't get stuck. We haven't had any problems with him since we received him for Christmas and plan to keep Jarvis and other roombas a necessity in our household from now on."
12/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,so far love itÊ one year in if it lasts a few more i will not regret the purchase,"i don't know how long this will last but for now I love it.Ê may not be a perfect vacuum but it does a decent job on hardwoods, tile and carpet and it puts itself on the charger when it gets tired.Ê easy to clean relatively quiet for a vacuum and you can turn it on in one room with its base plugged in and it will take care of it all by itself.Ê can't say that about most vacuums, or people either.Ê time will tell if it continues to work.Ê have had it a year this month.Ê one question i have is if the battery dies can it be replaced?Ê i know you can replace the brushes and rollers but at some point the battery life will fail and it would be great if you could change that out.Ê would not buy again if that proves to be not an option because these batteries are the key to everything"
09/09/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,I do love the fact that I can program this to run ...,"I do love the fact that I can program this to run while I'm gone at work. It is kind of ""dumb"" sometimes and just bumps around, but it goes over rugs and under furniture which is awesome. I like that you can set up virtual wall so it doesn't go into rooms you don't want it to. If you run it regularly, you don't have to worry about emptying the bin as often, but otherwise it can get filled up quick. I have a rug that sheds and when it goes in that room I have to empty it every time."
7/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Roomba's Fantastic!,I didn't want to like Roomba because it was so expensive.Ê I was hoping she wouldn't work so I could return her.Ê Well - Roomba definitely earned her keep.Ê I vacuumed with my ball vacuum before giving her a try - she picked up a lot of stuff my upright vacuum didn't!Ê I thought for sure she would constantly get stuck on things because I live in a small house with tons of obstacles - she navigated through them with ease and I didn't have to free her once. She went from room to room seeking out dirt and she certainly found it.Ê Emptying her bin is a breeze which is good because I had to do it 3 times on her first cleaning job.Ê I can never give her up - now if I can get my old dog to stop barking at her!
10/29/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,Save your money!,I decided it was finally time to upgrade my very old roomba to a newer version.Ê This roomba worked....for 2 months and then the side brush stopped working:/Ê Such a waste of $629.99.
05/12/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Amazing little appliance...,"I could not be more pleased with the Roomba 880.Ê I have a Cairn terrier who sheds beyond belief.Ê I have been using a German made conventional vacuum (brand name withheld) that cost nearly as much as the Roomba 880 and I was shocked, to say the least, at how much hair, dander, and dirt the Roomba picked up after what I thought was thorough vacuuming with the conventional style vacuum.Ê Needless to say, the first two or three times I used the Roomba emptied the bin more times than you can imagine.Ê With regular use, I may have to empty the bin two or three times for a 1600 square foot home.Ê My house consists of stained concrete floors, Persian area rugs, ceramic tiles, and short shag carpet.Ê It handles all of these surfaces perfectly.There are some reviewers who state that the Roomba misses places.Ê I do not have that problem.Ê I suspect that they are not letting the robot run long enough to do its job.Ê Others complain that it gets trapped too easily.Ê I have a sofa that the Roomba gets trapped under.Ê To prevent this from happening I simply use a couple of light houses.Ê Every third or fourth time vacuuming, I will tip the sofa onto its back and let the Roomba do its job ""under the sofa"".Ê Overall, it does a good job spitting out electrical cords, speaker wires, etc., but it is not infallible.Ê If you find a wire or cord that is problematic, then just temporarily move the offender.Suggestions for those considering purchasing or who have already purchased but critical:1.Ê Read the instructions.2.Ê Follow the instructions.3.Ê Make the areas that the Roomba is vacuuming, Roomba friendly if necessary.Ê Use your virtual walls, light houses, books, or whateverÊ to prevent entrapment in known problem spots.4.Ê Allow your Roomba time to do its job.Ê It is only vacuuming a 6.5"" swath at a time.5.Ê Enjoy your clean floors."
3/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Love Love Love it,I cant believe I waited so long to get one!. Love Love Love it! I was skeptical at first. The control freak in me wasn't too impressed in the beginning. I figured it would outline the room and then go back and forth vacuuming... no it tends to wander around in a criss-cross pattern. I made myself leave the area it was cleaning for about 15 minutes. Came back and everything was picked up. Yes it was worth the money. I have it clean everyday. We have three dogs and a cat. I can see a huge improvement in the amount of dog hair that collects in the corners and all over the floors. Like I said in the beginning... I cant believe I waited this long to buy one. I love mine.
2/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I cannot believe how great this iRobot works,I cannot believe how great this iRobot works! It is unbelievable at the amount of dust it collects every day...I wish I would have bought years ago...
11/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,ALL THE YES,"I can't live without this, now.... how did I ever? I got it to suck up cat and dog hair, since my numerous vacuums simply won't pick up the pet hair from my hard wood floors- and the roomba does exactly that. For the first time my floors are actually entirely clean, and all I have to do is empty the thing! This is infinitely better than sweeping, vacuuming, and sweeping over and over again on a daily basis."
12/15/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Great addition to my house - with proper preparation.,"I can't believe what this little fellow picks up.Ê I really like it a lot.Ê One word of warning to pet owners.Ê Twice now, my cats have barfed prior to Brutus (yes, I gave it a name) doing his programmed morning routine.Ê Let me say that was a real mess and totally ruined what might have been an otherwise wonderful morning.Ê I eliminated the programming and completely survey the floor before manually starting him now.Ê That is my only reason for the 4 stars."
1/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Canceled the maid,"I can't believe this Roomba is keeping up two dogs and a toddler across somewhere around 2,000 square feet.Ê We do have to empty the vacuum every day and I've had to replace the rollers a few times, but the 880 has served us well for the last 6 months.This has been a very expensive vacuum investment, not just on the upfront price.Ê Due to varying combinations of dog hair, long human hairs, and the occasional wire or string I've had to replace the extractors twice.Ê When replacing extractors why not replace the side brushes too.Ê I don't like to think about it (am now though), but I'd guess we're approaching the $1,000 investment in the 880.Ê However, I find some comfort in knowing maid service quotes have been in the $400 per cleaning territory (4,000+ square foot house) and I haven't felt the need to hire a maid since getting the Roomba.The 880 runs every weekday, while we're at work, and about every other week I'll let the Roomba mop hit the wood and tile floors.Ê We still clean one of the floors of the house in the traditional way (with one of those old school vacuums you have to move around with your hand), but overall I'm ecstatic I've been able to cancel the maid service."
05/10/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,How did I live without a Roomba?,"I can't believe I didn't buy this sooner. I have 6 dogs.Ê I vacuum every Monday, but by Wednesday there is a lot of dirt and debris on my rugs and concrete floor.I scheduled the Roomba for everyday but weekends. The first day it ran and the bin filled up in an hour. I emptied and let it continue. The next day it ran while I was away and it filled up again, but finished.I love coming home to clean floors!Ê It cleans pet hair, dirt, dust, grass and whatever ends up on the floor.I have dark colored carpets and it works fine. I bought the 880 because the other models said this was a problem.I would highly recommend this robot!!!!"
5/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,It's great -- just buy it,"I can unequivocally say this is the best thing we've bought for our home in a decade.Ê It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny.Ê Just buy it.Ê Really.Pro:-- Some say they empty the bin every week.Ê We have 2 cats and 2 dogs.Ê We need to empty it EVERY DAY because it's full that often.Ê I had no idea there was so much dander, dust, lint and hair to be found on ourÊ floors. It was shocking.Ê It's great to have this little guy vacuuming all that up every day, and I'm happy to empty it every day.-- On carpet it's super quiet and you won't notice it.Ê Most of our floor is wood/slate, and we definitely notice it (but not more than any other vacuum)-- Really simple to ""program"".Ê All done on with the buttons on the unit-- Some believe this is a ""bump and turn"" kind of random pattern machine. I don't think so -- it seems to remember the shape of our house, and whiel there is some randomness in the paths it chooses (or seems to be), there's also intelligence and accuracy.Cons:-- Plan on some routine cleaning to keep sensors and moving parts clean and clear of hair that gets wound around them.Ê Not a big deal, but you'll do more routine cleaning than you would with a vacuum cleaner (have you ever needed to clean your vacuum cleaner? neither have I :-))-- The cover that holds the HEPA filter in has a simple catch mechanism that wore out quickly due to normal removal of the filter for cleaning.Ê For the price of this appliance, iRobot should design a better way to keep that filter in there.Ê The catch that broke isn't *really* essential to the operation of the unit, so we didn't need to replace it, but it just seems like putting a cheap component into an expensive machine is kind of silly.-- Gets stuck under some of our counters...repeatedly!Ê The included ""fence"" devices solves the problem (we just fence those areas off so it doesn't go there).Ê But wouldn't it be possible for the unit to ""remember"" where it gets stuck and ""don't go that close next time""?Ê I would think it should! It's just math...Even with ""con"" items, this is such a great product and has revolutionized things around here.Ê I can't imagine not having a robot vacuum cleaner (especially with so many pets contributing to the level of need)."
6/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,A great success in my homeÉ plus fun!,"I bought this vacuum with a bit of uncertainty that it could be my only vacuum for a 3 bedroom house with a basement. It does the job beautifully. I cannot remember a small appliance that has ever made such a difference in my home. I have never been happier with a vacuum in my life. I have to admit, it has only been a few weeks. And I have never tried a robotic vacuum before. I do not know much about the durability of Roomba. However, I find it extremely easy to clean and somehow very fun! I use a forced air spray can to clean the filter and this makes it almost like new."
8/24/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,"Damages furniture, gets stuck all of the time","I bought this vacuum recently and am extremely disappointed.Ê It's a really cool idea, but the product feels half-finished and the technology is really unimpressive.The biggest issue I've had is that the robot tends to get confused and rub on furniture or the floor until it causes damage.Ê This has happened several times, despite me buying tons of extra virtual walls and putting them everywhere.It also often gets stuck, despite our apartment having very few furnishings and nothing tricky.Ê Then the battery dies if you don't find the robot and put it back right away, which means the clock gets reset and the robot may start cleaning at 5am when it does get recharged! (This has happened a couple of times now)The virtual walls and lighthouses are also a disaster.Ê In my experience they work about 90% of the time, meaning once every week or two, I find the robot in a room that was supposed to be blocked by a virtual wall.Ê When this happens, the robot often knocks things over, scuffs furniture, etc.I really like the idea of this product, it's just very poorly implemented.Ê I feel like I spend more time managing the roomba and repairing it's damage than I would have spent vacuuming!"
6/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,and the Roomba is great for cleaning under beds,"I bought this vacuum because I was tired of daily vacuuming my big living room because of my 2 big hairy dogs. Every day my Shark vacuum bin was filled with dust and dog hair.Ê The Roomba 880 must not have a very powerful suction because it picks up almost no dust.Ê The dog hair is picked up but rapidly clogs the entrance to the bin and the bin full light goes on whenÊ there's not much picked up.Ê Right after running the Roomba until the dock light goes on,Ê I run the Shark vacuum in the living room.Ê The bin of the Shark is about as full as when I don't run the Roomba.Ê Also, because the living room is large, the Roomba gets lost half the time and doesn't find the docking station.The pros are that the little twirling side brushes can clean around furniture edges and wall, and the Roomba is great for cleaning under beds.Ê It's also entertaining to watch for both humans and pets.Ê I like the unit well enough to keep it, but if I had it to do over, I probably wouldn't buy it"
11/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Effectiveness depends on the type of pet hair,"I bought this unit several weeks ago. We have a cat who sheds profuse amounts of fur and a dog who does not sheds little to no fur. This unit is absolutely wonderful for picking up cat hair and dust particles. If you have a short haired cat, it works very well. However, during the Thanksgiving holiday our daughter brought her golden retriever who spent 3 days. The dog sheds a lot of hair and the Roomba was very ineffective picking it up. So, I would recommend this unit depending on the type of pets you have. One more comment.........my husband who notices very little about the house mentioned to me that since we have this unit, the hardwood floors positively shine. We use it 3-4 times a week. Basically, I think it was a great investment."
7/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Mom's best friend,"I bought this Roomba to help me maintain a clean living space for my adventurous daughter and minimize dust for my husband and I.Ê My home is a mix of thick carpet, hardwood floor, and tile and offers a variety of fun and interesting obstacles for the Roomba to navigate around (kid toys, chair legs, a telescope, etc).Ê I was so excited when the box arrived, that I opened it up immediately and started to play with my new best friend.Ê Maid Marian (my Roomba) was very easy to set up, does an impressive job cleaning and navigating, and (so far) is easy to maintain.Ê I think she's going to inspire me to get some more robotic friends for my home.SetupThere is a set of word-free instructions with a series of simple pictures, and a more in-depth manual with reasonably thorough descriptions of each of the components. The Roomba itself is pretty straightforward and easy to figure out, and you can always augment your knowledge with Google or YouTube if you need to.Ê The only thing that I was confused by was the Virtual Wall Lighthouse beacon.Ê Apparently there are three kinds of beacons, all included in the instructions, and I didn't realize this until my second time reading through information for the wrong one.Ê Once I turned the page and figured out there was more than one, it was pretty easy to figure out that the Virtual Wall Lighthouses (it comes with 2)Ê were the ones I was looking for.The Virtual Wall Lighthouse beacons are meant as a guide to teach your Roomba where the barriers between rooms are.Ê Lighthouse mode tells it where an edge between two spaces are, and it will finish cleaning the room it's in before moving to the next room.Ê Wall mode tells your Roomba not to go past the beacon. The best placement for these is on the far side of a threshold, behind, but level with the wall/door frame so that they do not interfere with each other and so that your Roomba can find it and clean as much as possible around it.Note that the charger for the Roomba needs to be against a wall since the Roomba drives up on it to charge its battery.Ê It's not in the picture I included, but I ended up taking a twist tie and cinching up the cable to keep it in one place better and minimize the chance for entanglement.CleaningI was very impressed to see what my Roomba picked up when it was done.Ê I have long blonde hair and my husband has a pretty thick beard, and between the two of us we get lots of hair everywhere.Ê The Roomba had no problems with any of it.Ê It even ate all the Cheerios my daughter had sprinkled around the dining room.Ê It had an unbelievable amount of dust in the bin considering it hadn't really been that long since I had swiffered and swept my home.Ê I included a picture of the first pile of dust that I emptied out of it, and that was just for the hardwood and tile rooms! The carpet cleaning was amazing, and she even cleaned up all the horrible things that have been lurking under my bed for years!Ê I must advise cleaning out the bin multiple times during her first clean of your rugs since there will be a LOT.Ê This little girl can clean!PathingThe instructions indicate that it does a combination of 3 things - dirt pile seeking, spiraling, and wall-following.Ê I'll freely admit that I followed my Roomba about my house for her first adventure, and I could distinctly see these traits plus a few others.Ê She deftly navigated around table legs and chairs, under my couch, around my treadmill and its pad, and even found a path around and behind my couch to clean up around my telescope!Ê The only thing the had a little trouble with was my daughter's Splat Mat under her high chair, but I taped down the corners to keep it from rolling up as easily and she had no problems with it for the second cleaning.Update: Roomba is very good at slowing down when she approaches the walls so she won't bump and scratch them, but she can sometimes have trouble with things like table chairs.Ê She's never scratched my furniture but it would be a simple thing to add a padded strip of foam or something around the rim if needed.Roomba room prep:I highly recommend picking up small things for your Roomba's first day and following it around to understand more about how it works so that you know what state you can leave your home in if you plan to let it clean while you're away.Ê Otherwise you may find a few mat corners folded over and some toys pushed into strange places. I picked up things I wanted her to clean under and set them on top of furniture she could get under, but I didn't bother with things like chairs.Ê I taped down the corners of the Splat Mat that sits underneath my daughter's high chair to minimize the risk of entanglement (she struggled a little the first time but never actually got stuck, I just wouldn't have left her alone with it like that).Ê I also recommend picking up electrical cables that your Roomba may run over.Ê Heavy duty ones aren't an issue but I can see the thinner ones (like USB) being a tasty snack.MaintenanceIt's very easy to empty the bin.Ê You just pop it off, open up where the little yellow arrows tell you to, and dump it.Ê You can even take out the HEPA filter if you want to and give it a good shake or dust bust it to prolong its use.Ê There is a blue starfish light that will appear on top of your Roomba when the side brush is slowing down. It may be friction from your rug, or it may be that your little side brush is tangled and you need to clean it off.NoiseThe Roomba is impressively quiet for a vacuum cleaner.Ê I followed her around with a decibel meter (yes I'm a nerd) and found her to tick between about 70-72 onÊ hardwood floors.Ê For reference, my home is between 40 and 50 decibels normally.Ê A typical vacuum is about 80, and conversation is about 60-65.Ê I was able to listen to my audio book on my phone's speakers and do dishes while the Roomba was cleaning right behind me.Misc:Batteries can last for 2-3 hours no problem - I haven't hit the limit yet.Ê It takes a lot longer for the first cleaning, but I separated out places so I could watch her do each new area.The Virtual Wall Lighthouse can survive a brutal beating from an 8-month-old baby.You need to sign for delivery.I'm still learning about my Roomba and I will update this as I learn more."
09/01/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,THE ROOMBA - MY BEST PURCHASE EVER!,"I bought this on August 12, 2014.Ê I had a couple of friends who had a Roomba who ""loved"" theirs.Ê I was skeptical.Ê When I saw them advertised for the first time years ago, my initial response was ""how stupid, there's no way that can work.""Ê So I was surprised when several friends really liked theirs - especially for pet hair.Ê I have 6 dogs.Ê I have to vacuum continuously just to keep the pet hair at bay.Ê So my husband and I discussed it, researched, and read reviews and decided to take a chance.Ê Our thought was ""If it didn't work, it didn't work.""Ê The Roomba arrived, and we set it up.Ê It has a quick start manual, and we gave it a try.Ê It was fun to watch, to see what it would pick up, what it might miss.Ê Whatever it missed, it ALWAYS came back through and picked up.Ê It has now been three weeks and I LOVE THIS VACUUM!!!!!!!Ê I mean I REALLY, REALLY LOVE IT!Ê I run it daily, and I don't have to do anything.Ê This precious vacuum is a diligent hard working machine (I like it so much, I'm ready to name it - yes I know I'm ""anthropomorphizing) and it WORKS!Ê I mean really works.Ê I'm astonished to see all the hair it picks up!Ê I'll stop it in the middle of a cleaning cycle to empty the dust bin (even though it lets you know - by beeping and talking - when it needs to be emptied), and I'mÊ always astonished to see how much pet hair, dirt, sand, etc. it has picked up!Ê I ordered extra filters as several reviewers suggested, and I change them more frequently than they need changing just to keep my Roomba in excellent condition.Ê Anything that works that hard deserves to be taken care of.Ê My floors are staying clean - I haven't had to vacuum with my Miele once, although you will have to have a regular vacuum, because there are areas the Roomba will not fit under.Ê I usually just take a broom, and sweep the areas it can't reach, and leave the dirt and stuff for the Roomba to pick up.Ê My furniture is much cleaner because there's no pet hair to be blown around by ceiling fans and re-distributed to furniture!Ê I haven't read the entire manual yet, it's summer and we've been busy, but I know you can program when you want it to clean.Ê The COOLEST and cutest part is that it puts itself back on its charger when it has completed cleaning!Ê Because I like it so much, I'm ordering a second one this month to keep upstairs.Ê I'll probably learn how to program that one and then just let it do it's thing.Ê I have never had a machine that I've loved.Ê I like my Bernina sewing machine, our Bose iPhone player/dock, they're great, but this Roomba is the best invention ever!!!!!Ê DON'T THINK ABOUT IT, JUST BUY IT!Ê YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!"

3/31/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Rosie the Roomba is my parent's favorite gift,"I bought this happy little robot for my 60ish year old parents for Christmas. I didn't expect such incredible results. My parents have a 1 floor 1600 sqft mixed surface house in the AZ desert. They have 2 little animals that shed and create the havoc that gives homes harmony. The results are very good.My parents love ""Rosie"" the robot as my mom calls her. Here are some notes from the first 6 months:Day 1) One of the dogs follows Rosie around. Job (min-pin) is quickly understanding that even if she runs into him there is nothing to harm him. Lots of hair from the rugs. Emptied the dirt trap a couple times.Day 6) The tile floors constantly look great. No dust. Very little rug hair anymore. Easy to empty the dirt. The virtual walls don't always work but I think we put them in odd places that don't give Rosie the Roomba enough room to turn. The Roomba doesn't replace your need to vacuum when you make a mess but this little maintenance droid removes the dusty dirt, dog hair and tiny rocks you can't always see but feel without shoes when on tile floors.Week 2) Nothing to fix. No problems. Mom loves Rosie. They empty the dirt trap every day even though it isn't necessary anymore.Month 3) Still chugging along. Rosie is programmed for 6:30 to 7:30 am and the dogs don't even look at her anymore.My parents told me this is the best gift I've given them. I'd like to think the work I put on the fridge was awesome but so far Rosie is incredibly successful at making my parents life a easier every day. My parents show Rosie to all their friends.Rosie can get stuck under padded edges of couches but that rarely happens. She is also heavy for her size but you don't have to pick her up often."
12/26/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Does A Good Job On Kitty Litter,I bought this for my daughter as a wedding present.Ê They have cats and often have kitty litter tracked throughout the house.Ê The newlyweds absolutely love the Roomba.
7/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Overpriced for the lack of any intelligence,"I bought this expecting it to clean my small 600 sqft studio easily. The first day after observing it's behavior, I decided to return it. I bought this after not doing much research and trusting the Roomba brand. I know these have been out for a while, but expected a lot more from this product after being on the market (the Roomba brand) for so long and the $700 price tag. This thing is not at all intelligent. I assumed it would at least do some basic room mapping initially and increasingly get more efficient, but it doesn't. That is why you are given the virtual lighthouses/virtual wall accessories, because this thing is very dumb. It simply starts in a circle, and then runs across the room until it bumps into something, often bouncing off at either a 90 degree or 180 degree angle. This results in it often getting lost in the same areas of the room and missing other areas. If I was to buy another automatic vaccuum I would consider the Neato D80 which apparently does some basic room mapping and is shaped square like a traditional vacuum to get better coverage in corners and along walls."
4/25/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Works extreemly well - supports international voltages out of the box,"I bought this direct from iRobot and shipped to New Zealand via a forwarding company; the charger is multi-voltage and supports anything you're likely to want out of the box.We have a three storey house and run a 780 on one level, this 880 on another, and a second 880 will arrive soon for the third floor. Compared to the 780 the 880 cleans better (and the 780 already did a good job). We have a husky and so pet hair is dropped throughout the house everyday. The 880 is superior to the 780 by not needing to have the the rollers cleaned after every use. The dust-bin is larger too.The 880 is quieter than the 780 although it's still noisy; we run the 880 at 3am each morning and occasionally it will wake me from the next floor but generally I sleep through the clean cycle - when we get up in the morning the floor is clean.The filter on the 880 is much improved over the 780 by being bigger and fitted with a fine-mesh screen that keeps the bigger dirt from getting sucked into the filter. This filter needs cleaning after every use for us and I generally tap the filter with a heavy metal object to shake the dust lose.The 880 has push buttons rather than capacitive-touch buttons and this means that false triggering of the buttons as happens on the 780 isn't an issue.The charging station and remote for the 780 and 880 are compatible. An improvement for the 880 is that the power plugs straight into the charging-station rather than going to an external transformer as it did for the 780.This Roomba navigates the floor successfully; we have a dodecagon shaped house and with the two lighthouses that ship with it thoughtfully placed this unit almost always finds its way back to the charger. Floor coverage is close to 100% and more than good enough to keep the floor clean enough for our standards."
6/21/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Temper your expectations (and grit your teeth at the $700 price tag) and you'll be rewarded,"I bought this at Bed, Bath, and Beyond because they accept the 20% off coupons for it, otherwise I probably would have gone Amazon. A few things to keep in mind when considering a Roomba:1) It does not replace your upright. The tech for never vacuuming again hasn't arrived yet.2) it does not pick up everything during every cleaning cycle. Be patient - it'll grab more every time.3) the ghost in the machine will inevitably pop up to haunt you. Don't set it loose in a room with valuables sitting atop frail tables, or cords for it to play with.If you're one of those people who enjoys vacuuming several times a week and can't stand the sight of an unclean carpet or floor - forget this product; It's not for you. It will cause you more frustration than it's worth.But if you're a slacker like me who doesn't vacuum nearly enough this little robot is a Godsend. You'll be amazed at how much gunk it picks up, My floors are SO much cleaner than they used to be. It seems to be doing a pretty good job of clearing the air in my house as well."
7/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Definitely Consider the Roomba if You have Allergies,"I bought this as a gift for my mother.Ê Two of her cousins have Roombas and she thought it would be very beneficial to her.Ê She uses it almost every day and is amazed at how much it collects.Ê My mother can't use a regular vacuum due to severe allergies, so the Roomba offers a huge benefit in both having no emissions and doing such a good job picking up whatever lands on the carpet during the day.Ê She did learn that you can't just put it in another room because it expects the docking station to be in a certain location and will be confused if not where expected.Ê The only problem she had was when the Roomba managed to get under a cedar chest and couldn't find its way out before the battery died - it took a while to figure out where it disappeared."
6/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Roomba is wonderful.,"I bought the Roomba 880 over two months ago and we love it so far.Ê Some of the negative comments I read in reviews here just weren't true.Ê Someone complained that the Roomba is loud.Ê Hey, it's a vacuum cleaner and it does make some noise but most of the time it runs when we aren't home.Ê It produces perhaps half the noise that our conventional vacuums produce so ""for a vacuum cleaner"" it's quiet.Ê The capacity to hold dirt is limited and I empty it daily, if that one minute task is a problem for you, this isn't the item for you.Ê We vacuumed conventionally before we cut the Roomba loose on the house and we were amazed at how much additional dirt it found.Ê We live in the country and have animals so there's always dirt and hair to clean up.Ê You do need to keep the house picked up, any socks or towels and occassionally an extension cord will cause the Roomba to malfunction.Ê We just learn how to help Roomba help us and keep items out of its way.Ê It's expensive and it isn't a miracle worker but it's great to have."
10/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,"Love it, but Cost/Value ____","I bought the 650 and had it for a week before getting the 880 as a gift. So of course, I returned the 650 and kept the 880. However; if you are looking to buy either machine save your money and get the 650. The 880 is a slightly better machine but it does not justify the much higher price in my opinion. Both cleaned great, and I could not imagine not having one around now. I have a 3400 sq ft home and I just let it run ever chance I have."
03/06/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Parts can be easily removed for cleaning and removal of pet hair and ...,"I bought one to try it out before I gave it as a gift.Ê I am very impressed so far.Ê It has it drawbacks, but in my opinion the pluses outweigh the negatives. As other reviewers have noted, the robot uses a seemingly random effort to vacuum a space. It won't vacuum the way a person would use a vacuum cleaner.Ê It takes about 20 minutes to do a large room. When working with multiple rooms, the use of the lighthouses can be very helpful. It will take at least one recharge to completely clean more than 2000 sq ft.Ê For apartments and small homes this is very ideal.Ê Larger spaces require more interaction with the robot.Ê It will get lost and have a hard time locating the docking station.Ê buying additional docking stations and lighthouses will reduce the interaction with the robot. After I get the hang of it, I will purchase additional lighthouses and docking stationsCleaning and maintenance are very simple. It is far easier than cleaning a traditional vacuum cleaner. Parts can be easily removed for cleaningÊ and removal of pet hair and lint. It is also much quieter than a traditional vacuum cleaner.Although it is not identified on the Amazon listing Square trade will warranty the product as Other electronic.Ê The amazon product code for the warranty is B003BLS926.Ê Enter the product code into the Amazon search bar and it will take you to page.Well I have had the unit over 1 month and I am still very satisfied.Ê The unit is amazing. It is easier to clean out than a traditional vacuum and it gets in places that may be hard or inconvenient to reach.Ê It sails under my sofa, a place that may only get hit during spring cleaning otherwise. I am thinking of buying another one for the second floor.I just bought my second Roomba for the upstairs and I gave one as gift.Ê I can't imagine how I did without it so long. Right now it is busy vacuuming my office as I type this update."
5/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Good thing for marriege,I bought it for my dear friend who is going to get married. It's really a good one for new couple and they like it very well.
5/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Why didn't I purchase this years ago?,"I bought directly from company, just in case I didn't like - that I would have an easy time returningOk, Ive had my Roomba for a week.Ê It has ran every day, except when we were out of town.Ê I havent programmed it to run itself, I just tap it on in the mornings.Ê It runs a couple hours or more.I dont think it has a rhyme or reason the direction it goes and I dont think it goes the same way every day.It will shut itself in a room if the door is not propped open.Ê (I havent used the light house and dont plan to.Ê They basically set an invisible wall that it doesnt go past.)It did get stuck/wedged under the edge of the dishwasher onceI think it just shut itself off.It did suck up a band-aid and chimed that I needed to remove debris.It doesnt go under my couches because they sit too low, but Im gonna have Mr. Fix-it take care of that.It does bounce in between the legs of the bar stools and dining room chairs.As it is running, I do occasionally clean the debris binI think sometimes it has told me that it is full.I havent dusted since I got it, but who am I kidding, I wouldnt have dusted by now anyway.Ê Unless I can clearly write my name in dust, it doesnt need dusting.I love that it goes under the beds.It has gone back to the charger on its own.Ê Sometimes when it does go back it moves the charger around.Ê I might Velcro it to the floor to keep it stationery. And I think one time it stopped and said it need to be charged.It isnt as loud as a traditional vacuum, I wouldnt suggest watching tv while its running, but you probably could if you turned the tv up a bit.Ê Im usually working in the office when it is going and its not annoying when it comes in.Amazingly it doesnt make the dogs go nuts.Ê It has bumped into Remington and then turned around.I can tell that my floors are cleaner.Ê I dont dread the daily sweeping up dog hair.Ê I am amazed at how much lint and dust it sucks up.even though it runs every day, the bin is still full.Ê I was skeptical on the area rug, but I did vacuum those yesterday and to my surprise there wasnt much in my vacuum.Why didnt I purchase this years ago?"
05/03/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,I absolutely hate the Roomba 880,"I bought a Neato Botvac 85, used it for one week (loved it) and it stopped working die to an error. Returned it to BB&B and upgraded to the Roomba 880. Big mistake. I loathe this vacuum. It hasn't vacuumed an entire room yet. Light houses don't seem to help. It will stay in the same corner for 30 minutes. I have used it now for about four days. It just finished the room I am in and never hit the middle. It will soon be going back and they can order me another Neato."

8/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,3 Shedding Pets? No Problem.,"I am so happy with Roomba 880. I get time back to enjoy my family, and I can walk barefoot in my house without having to vaccum daily. Our best investment in YEARS!!"
6/14/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Wow!!Ê Big improvement over 400 pet series,"I am so happy that I took the plunge!!!Ê I debated for months about whether to upgrade from a 400 series Roomba.Ê I LOVE this new robot!Ê I live with two 15 year old boys, a husband with many projects, a dog with wiry hair that sticks to everything, and two cats, and all of this in a climate with lots of silt and salt coming in during the winter.Ê The 880 has exceeded all expectations for picking up tiny particles of dirt and pet hair.Ê The programming works well and it is considerably quieter on wood floors than my old Roomba.Ê The 880 has no problem climbing on and off rugs.Ê However, like previous models, it would not touch my rug with black border and black sections. I tried all the hacks suggested on line to trick the cliff sensors and they didn't work. I decided to return the rug and keep the new robot!Ê For context:Ê I refurbished my 400 series with new brushes and filters and I reconditioned and replaced the battery.Ê I'll still use it in lower traffic areas of the house.Ê The 880 runs circles around it.Pros:Ê The new 880 has never called me to ""stop and clean roombas brushes!""--- this was a daily event with the 400 series.Ê The new brushless systems seems to work very well.Ê (Note:Ê all human and nonhuman animals living in my home have short hair.Ê I can't address questions about longer hair causing problems).Ê The dirt extraction is a huge improvement over earlier models.Ê The battery lasts about twice as long as the replacement battery which I bought for the old one.Ê The 880 bangs across metal floor grates and brick hearth without getting stuck.Ê It is respectful of cords and cables.Caveats: Previous models had washable filters.Ê The HEPA filters for this model are much more effective HOWEVER they must be replaced and do not appear to be washable.Ê I also own the Mint floor cleaning robot (now called Brava and sold by iRobot).Ê Mint maps the room and quietly and systematically crisscrosses the room, making clean lines.Ê Roomba is chaotic and apparently this annoys people.Ê If this bothers you, program the 880 to run while you are sleeping, or sit in your recliner and use the remote to drive it around to your liking.Ê The use of lighthouses (allowing Roomba to finish one room before moving to another and then finding its way back to the charger) is not intuitive at first---I am still working on that.Hope this helps!"
3/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"If you are thinking about it, pull the trigger. You WON'T be disappointed","I am so glad I made this purchase! Have a 1 story house with hardwoods through out. A few medium sized area rugs (low). Roomba works wonders! Like others have said the 1st few times you run it, it is impressive the amount of debris/dust it picks up! After a few cleanings it is much more minimal. I run mine once or twice a week. I have no pets (yet) but this picks up my long hair very well without it getting tangled around the rollers/ brush. Makes my busy life a bit easier and that was worth every penny. Does a good job not getting tangled up in cords(phone chargers, surge protectors, etc). Very smart and effective cleaning, does miss some corners occasionally. I wanted this to take over sweeping for me, which it does, and allows me to quickly swiffer my floors which takes care of the rest of the cleaning. I am by no means a neat freak or an OCD cleaner, but I do get particular about grime on the floor when walking around barefoot indoors. Roomba does an excellent job with this and meets/ exceeded all my expectations. Still trying to figure out my specific house and room configuration to set up scheduled cleanings, but the lighthouses seem to work well. LOVE IT!"
12/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Awesome!,"I am really surprised about the amount of dust and hair this thing picks up. It's easy to dump out all the debris and pop back in. I have it set to go off everyday around 10:30am, when no one is home. It can be annoying when trying to watch tv or concentrate on anything really because it can be loud. Our home is about 1500sqFt and it goes and cleans everything without needing to recharge. Sometimes it has a really hard time docking even though the station is literally two feet away. Its kind of entertaining actually, but does get annoying. Overall I completely recommend. This little guy can really do its job."
10/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Rotator brush split in half after two months!,"I am quite upset as my Roomba, which I've had for about two months, already has a piece broken. The dark rotator piece has split in half! I have no idea what caused this rubber piece to break, however I would really appreciate a replacement considering the age of the unit. Other than that I really enjoy this Roomba, It does a fantastic job picking up pet hair and more. I do wish it didn't go in such random patterns, but overall it does a great job. If the seller would please contact me about a replacement piece that would be fantastic. Thanks : )"
07/11/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,I have it scheduled to clean M-W-F and it seems like once a week it goes all over the house ...,"I am only giving this 4 out of 5 stars because the directions are not clearly written at all.Ê I end up looking at articles online trying to figure things out.Ê The Roomba does do a very thorough job of cleaning the rooms it goes into.Ê I am still trying to figure out how to make sure it goes into all the rooms in my house every time it is scheduled to clean.Ê I have it scheduled to clean M-W-F and it seems like once a week it goes all over the house but the other two times not so much.Ê But overall it was worth the investment.Ê I have a small dog who sheds a lot and hardwood floors.Ê I could never walk around barefoot unless I had just cleaned the floors, thanks to Roomba I can be barefoot in my house a lot more."
1/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Handles big messes well,"I am not a fan of vacuuming.Ê So I was a little worried when I bought this, thinking the Roomba may not be able to handle the level of accumulated grossness on my floors without a pre-vacuum from something more conventional.Ê I have two cats, one of which has fairly long hair and I'm very long haired myself.Ê They track litter everywhere. But I'm not about to buy a $700 robot vacuum if I have to pre-vacuum for it, so I decided to just let the Roomba loose.I confined it to one room at a time, and sure enough the Roomba was more than capable of handling even the grossest of floors. Yes, I did have to empty the bin 4+ times the first time it cleaned a room in my apartment, but eventually the thing finished and returned to base.Ê Now I have this thing set to run daily and my floors have never been cleaner.Ê It often finishes the whole apartment without the full bin light coming on.You will likely want to monitor it the first few times you run it in a room to see if there will be any challenges or ways to optimize its route.Ê It's a little entertaining, too.Ê The Lighthouses are a little confusing at first.Ê I think the manual depicts the usage of an older Lighthouse model--- the one in the manual has an arrow on top and the infrared beam leaves out the thin face of the Lighthouse rather than the wide one.Ê After about a a week I had it all figured out, and I don't think I can live without this thing."
5/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Best investment ever - shedding dog isn't a match for this beauty,I am IN LOVE with this beautiful machine. I have twins learning to crawl and a dog that sheds like crazy. I can't keep up. BUT I bought this and am in awe how much it gathers. I run it downstairs on the timer every morning before we get up. It's wonderful to not chase fur around the house. I run it upstairs during lunch to clean up before floor play begins with the babies. I couldn't be happier unless I had another just for the upstairs. :-)It's smart enough to untangle itself if it gets caught on a rug. It did lock itself in the bathroom when it went behind the door. It seemed destraught when it kept banging the door. I think it deserves its own name because it is now a beloved family member.P.S. It also gets under the entertainment center better than my housekeepers.
09/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I may leave my husband for 'Robert'!Ê He is AMAZING!,"I am in complete love with my Roomba.Ê We named him Robert and he is simply awesome!We bought a new house that is quite large and mostly hardwood except the bedrooms and playroom and with 3 kids and a dog we seem to accumulate a ton of dirt, dust, fur etc all day long.Ê I read a TON of reviews and ended up taking the plunge. TOTALLY WORTH IT SO FAR!I did not buy from Amazon but only because I had a significant coupon to a local store so saved a large amount.I read the manual and many of the Q&A on here so I had a pretty good idea how it worked when I got it.Ê So many of these reviews are helpful so I figured I would address some points I did not see in other reviews.1.Ê Roomba says it only cleans for 1 hour on a manual cycle but I find it runs for much longer.2.Ê I have not done the schedule yet because I feel like I need to see how big of an area it can do on 1 charge.Ê So for now I use the VLH and VW to keep it in an area so I can monitor it.3.Ê If I have it running in a room and the base/charger is not there, it will simply stop and turn off when it is done with the room(s).Ê This was something I couldn't find an answer too but figured it out from watching it.4.Ê Our second floor has the 3 kids bedrooms. I started it in one room, used a VLH outside so it did that one, then had a VLH at the next room so it went and did that and then finished and went to the last room.Ê It shut off if the 3rd room when done and I found it under my sons bed!Ê I then just brought it down to the charger and let it charge again.5.Ê Depending on the rug, the bin can fill up VERY fast.Ê The first time I did the master I had to empty the bin 3 times and then again at the end.Ê The second time I did it I had to empty it once mid cycle.Ê I could tell it needed to be emptied because dust balls were coming out!7.Ê The virtual walls and lighthouses are great and make Roomba very effective since it has such a random pattern and this allows you to know when a room is finished.Ê If it runs out of battery while running, IT DOES NOT REMEMBER WHERE IT LEFT OFF so has to clean the whole area again.Ê By using the LH you know that certain rooms are done since it only leaves the room when it is complete.8.Ê The virtual walls are good but anything can be used as one - door, baby gate, laundry basket etc.. I think the LH feature is much more useful.9.Ê I think 2 LH/Walls are enough but think it would not be as effective without them (think the lower models don't have)Thats all for now.Ê I am going to come back and update after a month or so to update if Robert and I are still in love or having trouble!"
8/20/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,Requires close supervision - recommended only for people with no furniture in their house,"I am disappointed with this device. If I use it in my bedroom, it gets stuck under the bed. If I use it in the dining room, it gets stuck under a chair. If I use it in the living room, it gets stuck between a chair and a wall. I even bought an extra ""virtual wall"" unit (total of 3) to try to control the behavior, but the device still gets stuck in every room. With the time I have to spend placing virtual walls and laying down obstacles to keep the Roomba from getting stuck, it would be faster for me to just vacuum the room myself. The top of the unit is already scratched from it trying unsuccessfully to extricate itself from the frequent jams it gets itself into. And all that trouble is to do only one room at a time. There is absolutely no way this device would handle multiple rooms in my house. And my house should be simple -- no clutter, no wires -- just basic furniture."
6/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"My dogs, me, and my roomba","I am completely in love with my Roomba 880: it is a life changer for me.Ê I am a dog rescuer, there are always multiple of dogs running around here.Ê I work full time and seeing a sheen of hair on the floor when I got home from work was just something I had gotten used to.Ê Other than when we had company, and we performed herculean cleaning efforts for days I figured it was just something I had to live with.Enter the roomba.Ê I have had it for about 3 weeks now and I love, love, love it.Ê We have a fairly large space, with all hard surfaces.Ê The upstairs has tile and high ceilings [something that concerned me after reading reviews but which has been a non-issue].Ê It is divided into two rooms, bedroom and living room and the roomba glides effortlessly from room to room.Ê I don't really understand the complaints about ""inefficient cleaning patterns"", for me the fact that it cleans, and cleans well, is all I care about.Ê And the noise?Ê I can watch T.V. while it is in the same room, for us it is not an issue.Ê I have a very heavy cast iron bed which cannot be moved and it has always been very, very difficult to clean under---the roomba cleans wonderfully under it.Ê It is probably the first time in 10 years that i have really felt dust and hair free under there.Ê Downstairs I was a little more concerned as the floor is very rough stone, normally used outdoors.Ê The roomba had no problems, and it cleaned under the kitchen island, another small miracle and game changer for us.Ê This little guy is just amazing and I catch myself just staring at it clean [the dogs got used to it by the first day].Ê I like to be in control of it if it grabs an errant sock or becomes full so I do not set it to go on automatically, I like to be here.I will add here however that as much as I appreciate the roomba 880 vacuum, I did not have a similarly positive experience with the roomba brava floor mopping robot---I returned that after it worked feebly for a few minutes then stopped.Ê But the Roomba 880 Vacuum is a wonderful help in my household that makes us very very happy and our environment so much cleaner with so much ease."

I vacuumed with a regular vacuum before letting the Roomba loose for the first time. Still had to empty the bin 4-5 times. It's a lot better than my conventional vacuum.

2/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Their house is usually pretty messy and big,"Got this for my place, as well as for my parents as a gift.Ê Their house is usually pretty messy and big.It does an excellent job going around and cleaning the place, but its more for maintenance than heavy duty cleaning.Ê This is not meant to replace your vacuum cleaner, you'll still need to keep that for emergencies.NOTE:Ê This is a little bit of a hack: but I found if you take your old vacuum and aim a suction tube inside of the Roomba's dust bin, its a pretty effective dust bin and filter cleaner.Ê Then, its when your manual vacuum is too full, you empty that out, instead of the Roomba.Ê I found it saves on time and helps prolong the life of the filter; other people might have a different experience.The robot is at its best when it runs on either a daily schedule, or every other day.Ê It remembers to tidy up the place, so you don't have to.Make sure liquid or paste-like substances are off the floor before the robot reaches it, or else the substance will get sprayed everywhere.For my apartment, this does a fantastic job making sure I never have to vacuum.Ê I don't have any pets and am fairly neat, so the robot goes about its business and finds its way back to the charging station 90% of the time.For my parent's house, they have a ton of cats, a dog and birds.Ê Their Roomba had to be emptied 3-4 times within its first pass through their house.Ê Since then, it has to be emptied after every pass (once per weekday).A couple of notes: the Roomba can detect if its approaching a ledge (such as a staircase) and it will back away from it.Ê If you have an uneven surface such as carpets on hardwood floors and doorways where the floor raises a little, I found its hard to predict what will stop it and with the robot will climb over.Ê I expected the Roomba to be stopped by the floor humps in the doorways, but the Roomba went up and over, no problems.Ê There is a carpet however, that will stop the Roomba, and it looks like its less of an elevation change than the humps in the doorways.Ê You just have to watch it the first few times and plan ahead.Lastly, I have found there's sort of a rule of ""three corners and four walls.""Ê If you put the Roomba in a large area which has roughly four wall-like barriers, and the exit is through one of the four corners, its chances of ever leaving that area during its run, get really low.Ê Generally the larger the exit you can provide for the robot, the better; so plan ahead."

9/24/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,God I love this thing,"God I love this thing, I just hate that the dirt container is so tiny you have to constantly empty it and the battery doesn't last that long :("
6/21/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"With the dual bumpers, it's a necessity, not a luxury","Given my lucrative profession, trading $600 for years worth of daily vacuuming was a no-brainer.Ê It was my first robot vacuum, so after a lot of research, I decided on the 870 for its new AeroForce vacuum design (the 880's remote and virtual lighthouses did not seem worth an extra $100).Ê I had to order it from the iRobot webpage as Amazon does not carry it yet.When I got it, I was amazed (and disgusted) with the sheer amount of dirt it pulled out of my floors (about twelve cartridges worth -- gross!).Ê However, the show was almost stopped immediately.Ê I have a lot of nice, dark-wooded furniture.Ê Although the Roomba is good about not slamming into my white walls or lighter furniture, I watched in horror as it plowed at full speed into the legs of my recliner, hassock, dresser, bookshelves, nightstand, and bed.Ê Small patches of the wood stain started to come off after just two days of use.Ê I fretted that I might have to return the Roomba, despite enjoying it so much.Ê I researched the issue and found theÊRobot Add-Ons Dual Ultra-Soft Bumper for Roomba.Ê I stopped using the Roomba until it arrived.Ê Installation was very simple, and my furniture has suffered no damage ever since.Ê I almost docked the Roomba by one star in this review, because iRobot really ought to install these things by default.Ê (Seriously, iRobot -- I paid $600 for a vacuum and you can't even install a few cents worth of protective cushioning to spare my furniture from a very well-known defect of your product?)Pros:* I suffer from allergies and have to take over-the-counter Zyrtec.Ê It turns out that not vacuuming regularly was a major contributor to my allergies.Ê Now that my apartment is vacuumed every day, my nasal congestion is gone (my voice is actually different), I no longer have hard nasal secretions, I don't itch or sneeze in my apartment, etc.Ê It is truly remarkable how much better my respiratory health is after just a couple of weeks.Ê In fact, my respiratory health is so vastly improved that I experience drastically fewer allergy symptoms even while I am outside of the house.Ê That's why I said in the title of my review that this device is not a luxury, it's a necessity.* It does a really good job vacuuming.Ê With its side brush, it's brilliant at cleaning edges.Ê It design is very powerful in general.Ê It hasn't yet left behind any visible debris; my apartment is pristine every day.Ê It fits under my couch, kitchen storage rack, bed, nightstand, dresser, and bookshelf, areas that I would rarely vacuum myself.Ê I'm still amazed at the amount of dust finds every day, given my apartment's spotless appearance.Ê I'm almost incredulous.Ê Where is all of this dust coming from?Ê How is it possible that a third to a half of a cartridge of dust accumulates in my 650 sq. ft. apartment every single day?* It's virtually maintenance-free.Ê Every day I take the cartridge outside to the trash can and dump it out, blow in it to get the rest of the dust out, then take the filter out and tap it against the edge of the garbage can.Ê I clean the sensors once a week and make sure there's no hair wrapped around the side brush and plastic roller things.Ê How great is that?* It's rather quiet.Ê I hoped it would be louder so that I could use it as an alarm clock, but it doesn't wake me.Ê It's a little uncomfortable having a phone conversation while it's in the same room as you, but not as bad as a regular vacuum cleaner.* This vacuum turned me from foul bachelor into neat freak.Ê Since I run my vacuum every day, I can't have stuff strewn about on the floor, so I have adjusted my habits to automatically produce less clutter.Ê It did not take long to learn how to robot-proof my apartment:Ê shut my closet, ensure the toilet paper is not unrolled down to the bathroom floor, don't leave stuff on the ground.Ê This tendency towards decluttering has positive benefits on my ability to concentrate and my stress level.Cons:* As mentioned, it will brutalize your dark wood furniture until you get theÊRobot Add-Ons Dual Ultra-Soft Bumper for Roomba.* Sometimes it fails to dock properly.Ê It ends up rotating the dock somewhat such that it no longer can situate itself upon it, leading it to roam around the apartment vacuuming continuously until it runs out of batteries.Ê It's for this reason that I would not be comfortable running the Roomba automatically if I went away on vacation.Ê This could probably be addressed with a sturdier base station.Ê The existing one is very lightweight, which is why it's so easily amenable to becoming rotated.Ê iRobot could address this with an actual Rooba-sized platform at the front of the base station.* It produces dust in the air while it is vacuuming, which bothers my allergies.Ê Of course, a regular vacuum does that too, and regular vacuums are even worse because by nature you are standing right where the dust is being kicked up.Ê I usually run it while I leave home (say, while I am exercising), or if I'm at home, I lock myself in my office and open the windows while it runs.* Although there is some intelligence to the algorithms it uses to determine its path (like cleaning along the edges of walls/furniture, going over an area repeatedly when it detects dirt, or the spiral pattern), its paths are still rather dumb.Ê You'll watch it bounce around like a pinball trying to get out of some tight spot it's wedged itself into.Ê It'll generally get itself out without your intervention.Ê It gets stuck once in a blue moon, say, wedged between my bed's leg and the wall, or it locks itself in the bathroom.Ê I have addressed that by moving the bed slightly and purchasing a door stop for the bathroom door.Ê Nevertheless, I get the impression that if the pathfinding algorithms were smarter, it could clean my apartment in a much shorter timespan.Ê But I don't really mind it the way it is.Ê Apparently iRobot will be addressing this in future models by incorporating vSLAM (technology acquired when they purchased Evolution Robotics).Final verdict:Ê except for the serious, show-stopping, dark wood brutalization issue that I addressed with the bumpers, none of the cons are serious enough to warrant subtracting stars.Ê I'm very happy with my Roomba, and I hope it serves me well for years to come.Postscript:Ê after being amazed with the Roomba 870, I became curious about the Scooba 450.Ê That recommendation is a little dicier -- layout and materials of your home are crucial in deciding whether to recommend the Scooba 450.Ê I give that one four stars because my apartment is conducive to it and it makes my kitchen and bathroom floors actually glisten."
3/13/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,1,Does not have a brush like the 770 which seems to pick up better(I tried ...,Gets stuck often at the edge of my stairway.

6/18/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Fantastic New Addition to the Roomba Family,"First, let me admit that I am a Roomba fanatic. We have four Roombas plus a Scooba. So I absolutely jumped on the opportunity to test out the Roomba 880 and see how it compared with the other previous Roombas.As much as I've always loved Roombas, this Roomba 880 is just amazing. They really do listen to feedback and improve their models. Our older models had ALL sorts of trouble with my long hair wrapping around and around the brushes. I used to sit there during TV shows patiently cleaning the Roomba innards out. With this new Roomba, the new rubber-style brushes are super. It barely has issues at all.The HEPA filter is great. You can definitely feel that far more air is moving through the system. That then means it picks up even more dirt and dust than it used to. It might take you multiple passes on a room before you're done with it the first time now, because you keep filling up the bin. It's just that good.It has all the usual, favorite features of returning to its charger by itself and being able to schedule to run when you're not around. Roombas in general are awesome. They are so helpful in keeping a house clean. This one steps it up a notch.I can't give high enough praise for this thing. Now I just have to find new homes for our other ones. I almost feel guilty about foisting our old ones on people and having them deal with the niggling issues of brushes and such. But still, an old Roomba is better than no Roomba. That being said, if you can afford this newest Roomba, I highly recommend it. And so does our cat, Juliet.We were sent a Vine review copy of this."
6/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,We love it.Ê Its become a member of the family. The wife named it Albert.,First time we used it we had to empty it every 5 minutes now that its programmed we only empty it after eachÊ cycle.goes out on its own every day while we are at work picking up the dog hair and debris and docking itself for a recharge. Told my wife she never vacuumed under the bed like this thing does. It does a better job than she did.
8/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Roomba Great!Ê Virtual Walls - Not So Much,"First off... this thing does a GREAT job on my hardwood floors in keeping my pet hair (2 cats) off it, as well as general ""dirty"" that happens from day to day stuff.Ê The menu system for setting up schedules is pretty simple and easy to use.Ê For the most part it doesn't get stuck often and does a great job of navigating around.Ê What I don't like about it... the ""virtual walls"" you receive don't work worth a s***.Ê There's no other way of describing it.Ê Trying to keep the roomba from going through an open bathroom door, I set one of the virtual door stations behind the plane (in the bathroom).Ê Roomba passed right through it.Ê So I follow the directions and set the virtual wall station in front of the door... same thing.Ê Like its not even there.Ê Tried using both stations flanking the door plane... still runs through it.Ê The Virtual wall stations have a blinking light when the roomba is active, so I know they are working, but they don't stop the roomba at all.Ê Plus they are large sit on the floor making a very unpleasing aesthetic to any room decore.Ê Other than that.. the roomba works great!"
11/10/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Is the Model 880 really that much better that the previous model??,"First I would like to qualify this review by stating that I've previously owned two model 790's and thought that model worked very well in maintaining our hardwood floors. We have a rather large doberman that sheds a surprising amount of short black hair.The 790's did a respectable job of processing the dog hair along with anything else that found its way onto the floor.I was excited when the 880 was introduced and the manufacturer boasted of the many improvements over the previous models.My wife and I decided to send one 790 up to the second floor to maintain the bedrooms and the other 790 down to the basement, which has a combination of wall to wall carpet and ceramic tiles.The brand new 880 was charged up and set free on the first floor where the majority of dog hair and day to day traffic were the heaviest.Within the first week of operation, i noticed that the 880 was prone to showing off its red blinking trash can which means the dirt canister needs to be emptied. I was surprised on several occasions that when i went to remove the dirt canister, it was no where near full of dirt and hair. Upon closer examination, the 880 has a problem routing debris past the two rollers and through the narrow slot leading into the opening of the dirt canister. There is a sensor located directly under the two rollers that senses this buildup of hair and dust and it triggers the red flashing trash icon to come on.In summation, my wife and I prefer the 790 reliability and consistency in cleaning over the new and improved 880 which we view as requiring a much higher degree of hands-on maintenance."
06/05/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,love it best buy ever,first I thought its a bit loud.Ê But after seeing what kind of dirt it finds every day I was impressed.Ê If you have cats or dogs than you need one.

Until we tried it for the first time, we didn't know that we had such significant dust at home esp carpets.... at first, we worried that it's ruining our carpets but it didn't.

I knew our floors needed to be vacuumed but had no idea how much hair/dirt/dust that little Roomba would collect. It made such a big difference how the floors now look!

5/17/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,The iRobot Roomba 880's ability to clean allergens from my floors and rugs amazes me ...,"Even though I was wild over the fact that I was going to have a Roomba 880 cleaning my house, it wasn't love at first sight.Ê In fact, for a while I was quite disgusted with the whole process.Ê What I needed to do was take my time and learn to work with the Roomba and get to know its capabilities.Ê After a few weeks we've both settled in and things are working out quite nicely.Ê Fabulously actually.My mistake was expecting more of the Roomba 880 than perhaps it was capable of.Ê There were things I needed to learn about from working with the Virtual Wall / Lighthouse to maintenance.Ê I didn't think I needed the Virtual Wall, but once I figured out how to use it I was quite pleased with the result.For several days I was not a happy camper.Ê In the back of my mind I was thinking that if the Roomba 880 was a maid, he or she would be taking a hike.Ê I ran up and down the stairs checking on the cleaning progress, which appeared to be between zero and none.Ê the darn thing seemed to be cleaning in a willy nilly fashion and kept getting stuck.Ê My Electrolux Silverado Deluxe canister vacuum seemed quite advanced in comparison.The Roomba got stuck on the corner of a large rug, got hung up on a pine room separator, and fell a few times.Ê It took a short tumble into the bathroom and when it went from the kitchen into another one.Ê My son said that the Roomba 880 had Cliff Sensors and shouldn't do that.Ê If you have a house built in 1840 like mine, some of the construction will defy any AI bot in the world and it did.Ê Later, when I set up a Virtual Wall, these issues were taken care of.Ê FYI, the tumble in the kitchen was due to the dark, slick surface of the floor and the rounded molding.I was not happy, my cat was totally freaked, but slowly things began to turn around.Ê I noticed that Liam Neeson (yeah, I named my Roomba 880 after him) began to do things that I liked.Ê That really fine pet dander, dust and hair began disappearing from my floors and rugs.Ê Things became cleaner and cleaner, and yes, I became much more capable of working with Liam.The Silverado still has its purpose and won't be retired just yet.Ê Those wide pine boards need help and try as he might, Liam can't get under the couch.Ê Instead of disgust, I've slowly grown to love my Roomba 880 and wonder what I ever did without it.Ê I really needed something to help me with dust and pet dander that set my allergies and asthma off big time.I've put together a video that I hope hits some major points, especially the part on maintenance.Ê It's not all encompassing, but will give everyone an idea as to what the Roomba 880 is all about.Ê I'll go over some of the particulars below to give a few extra pointers.I did register and name my Roomba 880.Ê I called customer service, got a number for tech and called them.Ê One ring and someone picked upÊ I had to think of something to ask so I inquired as to how to open my Lighthouse to insert the batteries (the picture in the manual is not for the 880).Ê I'm sure Delroy thought I was daft, but was patient and answered my question.Ê Thank you, Delroy for not laughing (I thought he was going to).Ê I received a couple of emails and now I know that Roomba cares for the customer and will go the extra mile.Ê I will be receiving two extra filters for registering Liam Neeson, have exquisite service, and now have a much cleaner house.The iROBOT ROOMBA:Ê Setting the Language:This is quite an easy process, but if you don't understand what the Roomba 880 is trying to tell you, it can be problematic. I have encountered some error messages and need to have them in a language I can understand.You simply remove the Roomba 880 from the charging dock.Ê Press the Dock button continually for a few seconds.Ê This would be what's called a ""long press"" if you were working with a Bluetooth device.Lightly tap the center Clean button until you hear the language you prefer.Ê There are sixteen languages:Ê English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Polish, Russian, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, or Chinese.Ê Once you have made your selection, hold the Clean button for a few seconds and it will set.Ê The Cleaning Pattern / Cleaning Modes:At first I thought Liam was not all there if you know what I mean, but finally figured out how to set the patterns and use a Virtual Wall (there are two in the box).Ê Essentially there are two patterns the Roomba 880 follows, Spiraling and Wall Following.The Spiraling can be set by either tapping Spot on the face of the Roomba 880 or on the remote.Ê When Liam began to spiral, the cleaning seemed much more controlled.Ê It spirals outward in a three foot circle and goes back to where it started.Ê It's a more concentrated way to work on a specific area, especially if you have an unexpected spill you want cleaned up.The Wall Following method is the one that appears to be willy nilly, but it actually isn't. To set this you either tap the Clean button on the Roomba 880 or once again, on the remote.Ê I can easily see that continued cleaning can lead to a specific pattern, but because my household continually changes, I don't have one (yet).Ê If you don't want that pet bowl shoved against the wall or your fine furniture banged around, you will need to set up one or more of your Virtual Walls (more on that later).I most certainly learned that Liam didn't like clutter and wanted it out of the way.Ê In time it was easy to look at a room and know what needed to be removed or moved.Ê If it couldn't be removed or I didn't want Liam to go past a certain area, I used a virtual wall.If you want, you can schedule a cleaning.Ê I wouldn't suggest trying this until you are quite familiar with the way the Roomba 880 works.Ê Once you schedule, the Roomba 880 will leave at your prearranged time and return to Home Base when done.Ê I much prefer moving Liam from room to room because I'm home most of the time and find I can ""supervise"" more.Ê Cleaning System:There are apparently several changes between the old and new Roombas, but because I never owned one, I can't speak from experience.Ê I do know that people were quite annoyed by the brushes that worked well, but became entangled with hair.Ê That isn't happening when Liam cleans.Ê There is some hair and fiber wound along the edges of the extractors, but they do not interfere with the cleaning provided I do periodical maintenance.The AeroForce Performance Cleaning System.This is where the Roomba 880 breaks away from the old system and most likely has listened to what the customer wants and doesn't want.Ê I've heard a lot of people complaining about the old Roombas and the brushes.Ê They were like a throwback into the last century when there were carpet sweepers.Ê I know because I have one and still use it now and then.Ê The hair tangles in the brushes and needs to be either pulled out and cut and pulled out.Ê Following are the two changes.Tangle-Free Debris Extractors.These extractors are like rubberized tubes.Ê When Liam does his cleaning, no hair accumulated around them save on the edges.Ê There's a bit of tangle, but when I remove the extractors (a simple process) I just pick it off.Ê Each extractor has a different geometric shape on the end so there's no problem putting them back in.Ê I actually had to wash these off when Liam ran over something wet, but air dried them and put them back in.High-Powered Vacuum Channel.This supposedly has ""accelerated airflow through a seal channel.""Ê I cannot tell you anything technical about this channel, but I must say Liam is picking up an amazing amount of very fine dust and dander, something I really need him to do.Ê When I open up the bin I'm quite pleased with what I'm finding.Ê Not that I enjoy looking at dirt, but better in the bin than in on my floors and carpets than in my lungs.Spinning Side Brush.When Liam is roaming along the side of a wall, I can see the little spinning side brush at work flipping dust bunnies where he can get at them.Ê If he misses on the first pass, he'll manage to get them on the next.Ê This side brush can be removed for cleaning.Ê I have yet to do so, but it can be removed via a coin or screwdriver.Floo"

I don't think roombas will ever even nearly replace actual vacuuming. It just gets stuck, wedged, congested, etc. The lack of actual cleaning logic is frustrating too. It will pretty often miss spots and go over others ten times. I'd try the other brands that actually map out the room, because the whole random walking thing is lame. Go spend the money on a good vacuum instead."

We've been using the Roomba for a week now and I really am amazed how well it works. We've scheduled our Roomba to go through the house every morning at 8 am. Only twice has it gotten stuck - once between legs on a chair and once in pile of cords under a bed. Other than those two little issues, this thing works great and the proof is in the dust bin. I'm not sure that every square inch of every room is being vacuumed but it's doing enough that each room appears to be cleaned and there's enough dirt, sand and dog fur in the dust bin to convince me thatÊ this Roomba really does work as described. Yes, $700 is a lot to spend for a vacuum...but when you consider you're also buying the time to actually do the work, I think a Roomba really is a good investment."

She is great for cleaning up spills and doing the work while I keep my daughter entertained. But, the one big flaw, is that it doesn't always pick up everything, especially pet fur. We have a black lab and a shih tzu that lived in our apartment for four months until we decided they would enjoy my parents house while we waited to move. They have been gone 6 months now and we are still finding black hair on the ground. We run the roomba all the time (we have a toddler remember) and occasionally find loose hair in the living room.Also, something to keep in mind is that some children are terrified of the thing. My daughter doesn't mind and swats the roomba away when it gets close, but my sister's toddler is terrified. She thinks the roomba is going to steal her toys and keeps putting everything on the coffee table, even when the roomba isn't out and about. Of course, this is also nice to help keep the place clean!"

10/24/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Super Clean House (eventually),"Does a great job cleaning my house with hardwood floors. (I don't have any carpet.)In particular, it gets those areas I would only ever bother to swift a couple times a year. Under couches, under the beds, tables, etc. This alone makes a huge difference.Not the smartest robot in the world. It essentially just randomly bounces around. Hopefully in the future they will introduce models with better navigation. It's frustrating to watch it repeatedly clean areas while 'missing' others. Only by cleaning for hours does it eventually get everything. My guess is a bot with some navigation would completely clean the space in 1/5 to 1/8 of the time it takes the Roomba to do it.So 4 stars for super clean house, 1 star deduction for taking 2 hours to do a 20 minute job.Keep in mind you will need to de-clutter your space prior to roomba doing it's thing. Doubt this robot would work effectively in a house with young children."

08/04/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Roomba Vs Siberian Husky,"Did you know that Siberian Huskies shed a lot? No really.... they shed a TON!Ê Prior to purchasing the iRobot Roomba 880 I would vacuum with my cordless Dyson every single day and every single time I'd have to stop half way so I could flip the vacuum head over and manually remove the hair that had been caught in the bristles.Ê This tedious task went on for approximately six months before I discovered that my wife and I are expecting TWINS! Immediately I realized that I would soon have more important things to do than vacuum daily.Ê However, at the same time it would instantly become more important that my house is clean.I spent the next month reading about Roomba and Neato and other brands who have developed nearly identical products.Ê Eventually I picked the Roomba 880 for one feature in particular--it's advertised as a maintenance free device. Calling a vacuum maintenance free is a bold claim, so I was prepared to send it back.Ê For the first couple weeks I never auto-ran the Roomba because I wanted to see how it operated.Ê Here is what I've learned from operating my Roomba:1) The Roomba 880 doesn't appear to ""mindlessly bounce around the room.""Ê The pattern is actually quite methodical.2) It's louder than I expected, but it's still relatively quiet.3) If I leave cables on the ground they're usually fine.Ê iPod cables, Android charging cables, power cables, etc. don't seem to get sucked up. The get picked up and dragged around, but I can grab them as the Roomba goes by and they easily pull out.4) The Roomba will hug walls, couch legs, dog crates, table lets, etc to clean around them.5) The bin holds a lot of dog hair, but I still empty it daily.6) Eventually it will find a way to get stuck.Ê It cleans my house every day and maybe once a week I'll see it get stuck on something.7) Everyone things I vacuum right before they come over--I haven't vacuumed since I bought the Roomba.8) Transitioning between hardwood, to tile, to carpet, to area run, to bathroom rug is flawless.Ê I have the edges of my rugs all run-tapped down, but my handheld vacuum would always pull up the edges. The Roomba doesn't seem to do that and the carpet is equally clean.After the Roomba ran I manually vacuumed and managed to collect a little hair and dust.Ê After manually vacuuming the Roomba managed to collect a little hair and dust.Ê All in all I find this point insignificant.Ê It seems no matter how good of a vacuuming job you do a different vacuum that works a different way will find something in your carpet to clean out.If I had to estimate how many Sq Ft of house it can clean on a single charge I would say around 1500.Ê That's with it having to navigate around couches, chairs, tables, etc.The vacuum itself is larger than I expected. It's still pretty small, but I imagined it would be smaller.The exhaust vent for the release air is on the top.Ê This was a relief because my current Dyson has it on the side.Ê This meant Husky hair would catch wind and scoot away from me.Ê Since the vent is on the top the hair stays stationary on the floor and is eventually picked up by the Roomba.All-in-all I'm very happy with the performance of my Roomba 880. Despite having a cat, dog, and wife who all shred hair like crazy my floors are always clean.Ê In addition, I've never had to clean the Roomba because hair is never stuck in it.Ê If you have any questions or want some pictures/videos of the Roomba in action leave a comment!"

The 880 has no belts like prior models...never gets clogged with hair on various parts of mechanism.2.

He magically adjusts his height depending on the surface or obstruction...don't worry about stairs, he is too smart for that.6. Only one suggestion...they should add audible alarm when he is full...there is a light but audible would be handy.7. One warning - watching the Roomba can be mesmerizing....you will be tempted to follow him around and watch him clean...force yourself to take a bubble bath :-)8. The Best most well thought out product I've ever used!!!!I'm buying another for our weekend home....P.S. The cats love following it around....suggest you don't get ""detective mouse"" cat toy if you have Roomba.

8/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,very good machine but requires some attention,"Considering this is my first roomba my expectations were great, after a couple of weeks of use I really see it very good job. I have a Golden Retriver, two children and it is a challenge to leave the floor without traces of hair especially under furniture.The type of floor where the use is hard smooth bright; is not as noisy as I thought, good performance and the virtual wall / lighthouse.Although the move seems totally random I have to admit that the rooms are clean at the end of the process; My house has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, living room and kitchen, about 300 square feet is cleaned all my roomba 880.The price actually is high but the completion of all parts is excellent.Negatives I found so far; can snag cables, shoelaces, backpacks strips, thin mats or magazines; it is better to remove them, can be mounted on some obstacles and getting stuck, the previous guide wheel can be stopped with hair if it is very fine, but it is easy to remove and clean it can happen.It is recommended to tour the house with the roomba the first time to review the potential problems; more clear floor best. It is best to place the chairs on the table to improve cleaning, also make sure you have no liquids spilled.Anyone know when the battery runs out? It really is incredible, it never ends.You can see the 880 working at my home http://1drv.ms/1vNrfPSIn summary a very good machine but requires some attention, especially considering its high price."
2/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Definitely worth the money,"Compared to the 200-model Roomba I had years ago, the Roomba 880 is a huge improvement. It picks up a lot more hair, dust, and fine dust; the main dust bin is easy to clean out; and maintenance of the various parts (rotating brushes, rollers, air filter) is very easy. I'd recommend having a few cans of compressed air handy so you can blow out the dust from the air filter. This Roomba has a good battery life, and he programmable schedule is very handy.

9/28/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Perfect for Dog Hair,"Can't live without this thing now. We have two heavy shedding dogs (short hair) and it cleans up after them pretty well. We have to empty the filter often though, but it beats all the vacuuming I was doing before this thing!"
6/17/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great for long hair (and kind of life-changing),"Can a vacuum change your life? This one seems to have changed mine. First of all, I hate vacuuming because of the noise and because my long hair gets in the vacuum brush bristles and I spend as much time with a serrated knife trying to free hair and stuff from the bristles as I do actually vacuuming (or more, maybe.) This Roomba is much quieter than a regular vacuum (although it may have gotten a bit noisier in the two months I've had it) and the rubber rollers that take the place of bristles grab the hair and push it off to the side so later you just need to flip over the Roomba and slip the hair off the sides of the rollers. It's SO easy. It's good with pet hair, too, although it seems to just push it into long, stringy clumps and then leave them on the carpet, where they are easy to pick up.As good or maybe better than the way the Roomba deals with long hair is the way you can set it to run each day at any time you want. I set mine to run every day starting early in the morning and use it as an alarm clock. So, each evening I look all around and make sure there are no shoes on the floor and that bag of trash I was going to take out is actually taken out and everything is neat and tidy. Then, when I wake up (sometimes a little bit before my Roomba ""alarm"", sometimes woken by the Roomba) I look around again to make sure no cat toys (or cat puke, which seems to happen just before or sometimes during the running of the Roomba) is in the way, and the Roomba cleaning the floor inspires me to start off the day by cleaning something, too.So, the Roomba has changed my life by giving me this regular cleaning routine and it's kind of amazing. I actually used to have the first generation Roomba and I used it maybe twice, forgot about it, and eventually gave it away. The fact that this one is programmed to run every day makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE.When I first started running it, the dust cup was full halfway through a cycle every time. After several weeks of this, I wondered if it was actually sucking dust from my downstair's neighbors place or...I mean...really? That much dust and dirt EVERY DAY? Finally, it stopped filling up each time and I guess my place was just that dirty and gross.It sometimes knocks its own base station out of place a little. Just enough that it can't dock itself again. Also, the virtual walls/lighthouses don't always seem to work. In one case, I think I had two doorways that were just too close to each other and one virtual wall was interfering with the other. I solved this problem by putting aÊCatit Design Senses Play Circuit, set in a gentle wave pattern, in a doorway. I also had trouble the first time I decided to leave and run an errand while the Roomba was running. I found it had escaped into the kitchen (may have had some feline help) and had errored out after going under a kitchen island and finding and picking up a piece of a broken coffee mug. No damage done, though, just a good reminder to clean under the darn kitchen island!Speaking of cats, I don't think mine are going to be riding the Roomba any time, well, ever. They aren't afraid of it, though. They like to lay down in the middle of the floor and then are surprised EVERY TIME the Roomba is SO RUDE as to head straight for them. You'd think after the 10th time that day the Roomba touched their back or tail they'd learn, but they seem convinced each time they've found the ONE SPOT the Roomba won't go.So, this Roomba IS GREAT. Because of it, I actually feel good about having people over to my place, and even after nearly two months my incredibly cheap rental carpet still keeps looking better every day. I would recommend it to anyone trying to develop more regular cleaning habits."
7/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Great for busy professionals,"By far the best device. We set it and forget it.

This vacuum worked well for the first two weeks I had it, and then it just stopped running on schedule. Anytime I had to clean my room I had to press the clean button. Obviously this was inconvenient as using the room and having a robot clean at the same time was causing issues. I contacted the manufacturer concerning this and simply they did not seem to care. I finally returned this item and wentÊ back to Neato! Waste of my time!!"
10/11/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Fantastic cleaning but sucky navigation,Bought this to use back home in India where we have 3 medium size pets with meadium shedding. The rubber rollers are a godsend! i just cannot imagine using bristle rollers - would need intense cleaning every week rather than the easy clean that i do now. All the parts that need to be cleaned come off easily and go backOn the flip side it doesnt navigate very well between rooms and sometimes goes off for no reason. So many times i come back to find that the Roomba has stopped somewhere and has not come back to home base5 stars for cleaning ability3 stars for navigation
06/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Wife loves it,Bought this for my wife on recommendation from my son. It is interesting to watch it work and it picks up dirt you don't see.
5/16/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Wife had recently become disabled and just cannot clean like she used to,Bought this for my wife on mother's day at $100 discount. Money well spent. Wife had recently become disabled and just cannot clean like she used to. This is great for under beds. A few things: 1. You will still have to get corners with a Swiffer or similar cleaning tool. 2. The first time you use it you will stir up a lot of dust. We had 2 room Hepa filters wide open. 3. You have to empty the bin often. But to me that is a small price to pay. 4. A small portable vacuum like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-FHV1200-Cordless-Ultra-Compact/dp/B002FQJW4W/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1431737686&sr=8-4&keywords=black+%26+decker+cordless+vac makes cleaning bin much easier.
06/04/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Irobot Power,"Bought this for my wife for Mother's Day....hey, it's a vacuum she doesn't have to push around.The day before, I let her vacuum just to see how well the Roomba 880 would actually work as read in some posts.When it was done cleaning 3 rooms (tv room, kitchen, and dining) it came back with lots of cat hair, and dirt!My wife couldn't believe how well it worked, and neither could I!PROS:- much quieter than standard vac- no more Human powered vacuuming!- it picks up a lot of dirt and does it wellCONS:- it's expensive..... but think of all the time you gain by not having to vacuum yourself"
04/09/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Love, Love, Love it","Bought this directly from iRobot as it wasn't available anywhere else yet...I have a 4400 square foot house consisting of hard wood floors, tile, regular carpeting, and super deep plush carpeting.Ê I have a house keeper that comes weekly, and I clean throughout the week in addition to the housekeeper.Ê That being said, I cannot believe how much debris this thing picks up.Ê I do have 2 teens with lots of friends, and a little furry dog that brings things in on her fur. And it has been a battle to keep my floors clean until I bought the Roomba.Ê I run it daily.Have you ever moved after living in a home for a few years, and seen the ""stuff"" that is under your bed?Ê The lint, hair, etc?Ê This robot goes under beds, couches, etc...where we typically don't clean, and gets all of the stuff. It did get caught under the bed once (was hung on a sock that was under the bed.)It is gentle when it bumps into things, and redirects itself.Ê I didn't think it would handle the very thick carpet (it is really, really thick) but it goes along pretty well on it.Ê I do have that same carpet as a rug on the hard wood living room, and it can't make the jump up that high...but I can put it on the rug manually and it cleans it fine.Ê I block the edges of the rug with the light houses to keep it on the rug...otherwise it runs off when it gets near the edges.We did a ""spot clean"" in the middle of the rug, and it does a spiral pattern and made neat ""crop circles"" in the carpet.Ê That amused the teens.It covers a room so well.Ê You will be amazed.Ê We have lots of allergies and I cannot believe the stuff I am getting out of the filter and bin each day.It is pricey, but it is so worth it...and if it helps with our allergies (think of the cost of allergy meds, etc) it will be really worth it.Ê I don't know how long they last, but I am reading up on the maintenance to make sure I get the most years out of it.Ê My mom wants one now.I opted for this model (880) over the 700 series because my daughter and I have long hair, and I dislike having to cut hair off of brush rollers on traditional vacuum cleaners.Ê This has rubber rollers.Ê I have not had any problem with long hair hanging up on it.Ê My mom has dogs that shed short hair, so we may go for the 770 or 780 for her house.I have not found anything to complain about yet with the Roomba.Ê I love it.Ê Two times out of the last 2 weeks it has not been able to find the docking station on it's own, but I redirected it and it found it finally.Ê My house is one level so is long and drawn out, and if the Roomba is in the back of the house and it decides it is docking time, it cannot ""see"" the dock.Ê If it is near the dock, it locks onto it and heads that way.Ê It has a flashing light on top that flashes ""dock"" and I simply aimed it down the hallway and it headed on home.Ê It behaves better than my dog or my teens.Ê Put it on your birthday, Mother's Day or Christmas gift list."
10/16/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Worth the Investment,"Bought my butler in April or May in the face of much family skepticism. Long story short: Roomba is my buddy. The kids tease me. My wife chortles, yet agrees our floors are more consistently clean than B.R. (Before Roomba). I'm thinking of giving my in-laws one for Christmas. Follow the directions for use and maintenance and the little guy will work flawlessly. My wife is amused that I've assigned gender. I did the vacuuming B.R. so why not a guy? I've learned he works best with frequent use, as the directions suggest. I run him every morning after we've all left (highly programable is another plus -- better than any human), except weekends when the kids sleep in. I'm giving him four instead of five stars for three reasons: loud (not as loud as our lonely Dyson, however), inconsistent self docking (you can program him to ""return to base when done"" and he parks and recharges -- fun to watch.), and ability to handle deep carpet. We have mostly hardwood floors; carpet in kids' rooms; rugs in family room, my office and my wife's Wife Room. He does all the rugs and carpets no sweat except in the Wife Room. That rug is quite thick (about half an inch) and he just bounces off the thing. The Dyson is happy with this situation, however; otherwise he would atrophy. Other than that rug he transitions flawlessly from hardwood to carpet/rug. He's got more energy for hardwood, however; the fibers of carpet tire him out faster for obvious reason involving physics stuff and terms like ""friction."" I really like this product and am totally comfortable that I'm getting my money's worth. Our dog is not a fan. But she's mainly the reason we got him in the first place. No more dog hair tumbleweeds! When they make one that cleans toilets I'm all in!"
7/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Expensive - But Really Happy with it!,"Bought much earlier version like 2005. Liked it alot, but required alot of maintenance - cleaned ok to good, not great. Lots of time cleaning it after it vac. Great idea - but this one: pricey, but so far, very pleased. Cleans hardwood, ceramic tile & area rugs very, very well. Adjusts to varied floor types in one area very well - missed nothing! Cleaning it was a breeze. Still need to try it on carpeted room - but very hopeful. This thing functions really well! WORTH IT!!!"

5/14/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"I really like mine, it works better than I had expected.","Better than I expectedOkay I am new to these automated appliances. I had no preference I have only observed these things on Youtube. I thought about getting one of these before before but its random method of cleaning did not make sense to me and did not seem like a real cleaning device but more of a novelty item. I called and spoke with someone who has one of the new 880's and she said it works great, it seems to make no sense to its routine and don't try and figure it out just realize it will clean the heck out of your floors. huh ok?But still I was leaning towards the Neato Botvac so I figured I would try the Roomba first since it was on sale and based on her recommendation and if not satisfied return it and get the Botvac and because of their history of problems get an extended warranty but I really liked the systematic approach it uses for cleaning and many people love them just like some who love the Roombas.Ok so I just got the Roomba 880 yesterday. Like you I had read probably a hundred reviews and watched some youtube videos but most of what Isaw and ready were based on earlier models.What I originally thought about the Roomba based on some reviews were:It would be loudIt would ""Slam"" into and damage furnitureIt would run only for about an hour then battery would dieIt would not pick up much except light stuff off the carpetIt would frighten my cats or they would ride it around.It would not replace manual vacuumingIt was not worth the moneyIt would not clean all the roomsIt would not find its way back to the baseIt would get stuck a lotBut in reality I discovered:It is not loud at all, in fact much quieter than my upright.It slows down before bump stopping to most furniture and wallsIts bumper is soft so does not damage anythingMy Cats are intrigued. They will watch it and are not intimidated by it.This 880 cleaned my floors better than my upright. I did not think that it would but it pulled alls sorts of stuff up. Clearly this is NOTjust a sweeper. I have not let it complete a full cycle yet so I cannot comment for it returning back to base. But I ran it this morning and it took 2 hours before the battery light came off of green and moved to Amber. It was still cleaning with no signs of slowing down or docking when I stopped it.I noticed that the bin full indicator does NOT stop the unit, it keeps packing it in there. My second run of the house and still get a fully packed bin.My first run I emptied the dust bin twice just from our master bedroom! I really can't believe it, this thing pulls up so much crap from myfloor it is amazing. Not sure how because my manual vacuum is a good but it just doesn't get into small places easily. This thing pulls all that crap from those hard to reach places like under the bed and especially between the wall and the edge of the carpet. My carpet is berber so it sort of scoots along on it with no restriction. By the way, in spite of all the cat fur it picked up there was nothing on the rubber extractors when I checked them.I think I might have a newer version model because my battery will clearly run for 2 hours before even coming off green. My 1400 sq foot single story house using the supplied two lighthouses. I put the base in the living room (center of the house) and the Roomba 880 visited the Kitchen, the dining room, the living room, and three bedrooms. ( I closed the bathroom doors because I have yet to remove the tassel carpets which I cannot vaccum manually and although the Roomba is supposed to be able to deal with them I did not want to run the risk of jamming up the roomba).Keep in mind this was my second run on most of these carpets and I still had a very full very packed dust bin. I notice on mine that thered dustbin full light will come on and the unit will continue to run.Also when it finds dirt it moves in a ""W"" pattern like you are painting a wall or vaccuming by hand not the ""Circle"" pattern as shown in videos of previous model units.It may not be a very systematic or organized looking approach to cleaningÊ but it works and it does a great job.Ê No idea about reliabiltiy or longevity at this point. Might not be a bad idea to get extended warranty, but I didn't get one with mine.My suggestion is to verify return policy and try one out, you really got nothing to loose execpt a bunch of dust and dirt. I am still keeping the boxjust in case but so far so good! I really do like mine it works better than I had expected."

Immediate after charging I put my Roomba to work and it did amazing with the pet hair.Ê Already, after 4 daily uses, the rug in which my cats love to lay on look ten times better.Ê I did finally use a stand up vacuum on it to help establish a baseline that hopefully the Roomba can maintain.Ê As it currently works, I do not seeing that being a problem.Ê I primarily have hard wood floors and it does a pretty decent job on them.Ê I do have one rug that the Roomba refuses to climb over because it assumes it hit a positive block or something.Ê A little disappointed in that but still happy with the results provided throughout the rest of the house.Ê It doesnt completely eliminate the need to vacuum occasionally with a standard vacuum but I can see the difference already when I come home after work.Ê The machine is rather noisy but not too crazy.Ê I still prefer it to run during its schedule time when at work compared to when I am home. (Although it is fun to watch these first few days.)I already bought a second Roomba for my downstairs level and cant wait for the tag team duo."

I wasn't sure which on I wanted to get and decided on the 880. I was still somewhat skeptical but since I was getting this for my woman to help her out somewhat, I bought it.After the package came it set around the house a couple of days before I decided to open it with her.Putting it together was pretty simple and the only trouble I occurred was charging it for the first time. The book said let it charge for the first time 17 hour. But on the Roomba the charged light was one. I still hooked it up to charge. After waiting for the time to run out I started to use it and saw the charge light was red and not green. I found out that when I put it in there to charge it I place it in correct (my mistake not the Roombas). then I had to wait for it to recharge again.I decided not to use it in every room the first time and made sure it had a clean floor to start off with. After doing just the living room and the kitchen (vinyl) I had to empty it 3 times, which wonder me because I have a very good vacuum cleaner that cleans fantastic (or so I thought).I wanted to make an comparison on what it would do in a room that I didnt vacuum first. So I had it vacuum my bedroom (which really needed it).After all said and done the rooms were very clean. The next time I used it I only had to empty it after it had cleaned every room.Love it and I am so happy to have bought this."

04/03/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,We named him Elmer because he loves hunting dust bunnies,"Been thinking of getting a Roomba for years, but wasn't completely sold on the idea - especially worrying about it eating rug fringe. Then I saw this model. He came to our home yesterday. We have named him Elmer - because he's hunting dust wabbits all over the house. I have severe asthma, and the rollers and HEPA filter really got my attention. WOW! What a difference. He has done wonders on our floors. He has his moments with the fringe, but he manages. We've torn out carpet, replaced windows, replaced A/C and change filters monthly, and there are at least two air-purifiers going in the house at all times. He still picked up a small dog's worth of fluff in this first 24 hours. And we don't have a dog! Yep, I love him. (And I never give 5 star reviews)"
6/20/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Awesome product.,"Beautiful piece of Engineering. Works very well on hard wood floors. Only issue is that my wife and daughter's hair keeps getting stuck in the brush and rollers. Other that that, nothing comes close to the way it cleans. Wish it had a smart phone interface. Especially since it costs more than the iPad I bought my wife, I would expect a 'smarter' feature. Also, it could use a larger trash reservoir. The pets hair really fills up quickly. It's still a little loud, especially if you trying to watch the tv. For all these reasons, I give it a four star. Otherwise, this would be a five star."

05/04/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Excellent cleaning performance; navigation could use some more improvement,"Background:Ê 2200 sq ft, single story, mostly tile, carpet in bedrooms, very open floor plan with some irregularly shaped rooms.Best features: The cleaning performance of the AeroForce extractor is fantastic... and disturbing... I thought my house was clean.Ê The first time Roomba came back with a bin full of lint, dust, debris, etc. I thought, ""Where'd you find that?Ê You made that up!""Ê Then I let it get its first full charge and sent it back out... and it did it again.Ê Apparently the house wasn't as clean as I thought it looked.Ê Its dirt sensors (I'm guessing are electrostatic in nature...) really do find very fine grained particulates.Ê Roomba 880 even pulls out the very fine sand/silt/dust that blows relentlessly here in New Mexico.Ê One reviewer said it wasn't a substitute for a broom, but my experience has been that it did a better job than manual sweeping, but couldn't quite match mopping or Swiffer/Shark style cleaners (there are other robots for that, right?).Biggest area for improvement: The navigation is a bit peculiar, and I find myself playing guessing games to figure out how to manipulate the physical environment to make Roomba more likely to succeed.Ê It has a standard repertoire of moves: forward, run into something, try to arc around it about 3-4 times, if that fails, make a 135 degree turn to go diagonally backward from the course that ran into this object, resume cleaning.Ê It's biggest challenge seems to be trying to figure out the actual dimensions/shape of the room versus what's just an obstacle within a room.Ê If you have a very open floor plan, particularly with irregularly shaped rooms, it seems like it gets confused.Ê The lighthouses help, and I actually purchased several more, which further improved performance.Takeaways: If you have a floor plan like the one I've described here, expect to need a lighthouse at the threshold of each room and some to subdivide large open areas (i.e.: kitchen --> living room if it's all one big area).Ê The more you subdivide the area to be cleaned into simpler, more square geometry, the easier time Roomba seems to have getting to 100% coverage.Ê Scheduling more than once a week (even just two days) seems to improve coverage, as Roomba appears to know where it spent most of its time in previous sessions and will focus more on areas that it hasn't visited as recently."

My wife is five months pregnant, we have a dog that massively sheds, especially during the summer, we live in a an apartment and we don't have time to vacuum everyday.Ê I read all of the reviews and did the research.Ê I decided to give it a shot.1.

It's quieter than a regular vacuum and I'm not usually home when it's going.Ê Trust me, it's not that loud!2. I have to clean the bin and filter every day. My dog sheds a lot so this is ok with me.Ê I can physically see how much it has cleaned up the floors.3. Our floors look and feel clean.4. Very easy to use out of the box.5.

Great feature!!The one draw back for me is the filter.Ê Can never get it clean enough.Ê But, I guess it's better that the dust/dirt is on the filter than on my floor.I would definitely recommend this for anyone with a pet or for anyone that does not have a lot of time to vacuum and want their floors to look and feel clean!"

12/29/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Saves you a ton of work, but don't use it on Pottery Barn rugs","As most of the comments show, this is a superb vacuum cleaner that will save people hours of hassles and work around the house.Ê It's rare to find something that can accomplish housework while you're away from home, but the Roomba does the job.Ê I initially bought it when I lived in an apartment with a low pile synthetic carpet that could take the beater brushes without problems.Ê Although the carpets looked fine, the Roomba picked up a surprising amount of dust with every cycle.I recently moved to a house and bought 4 large Pottery Barn wool rugs.Ê The instructions warned against using vacuums with rotating brushes, but the Roomba is small enough that I thought it would be okay.Ê I was wrong; the Roomba's chamber filled with clean wool fibers in less than half the cycle, and from then on, I had to use the virtual wall to keep the room away from the carpets.Ê I still use the Roomba on my hardwood floors, and I'm not sure yet if they are getting scratched from that use.Ê Overall, this is an ideal vacuum cleaner for low pile synthetic rugs that do well with rotating brushes, but you shouldn't use it on Pottery Barn rugs, and as another reviewer has commented, you should monitor your hardwood floors for scratches if you use the Roomba there."

12/11/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Pretty cool.,"An important thing to keep in mind is that the Roomba is designed as a HELPER, it isn't going to do 100% of the work for you so that you'll never have to clean your floors again. It will not replace your vacuum. It will only make your life a little easier.If you're a moderately clean person anyway or have hardwood/tile flooring, this thing will be the best purchase you've made in recent years.If your the average person with a whole house full of carpet, you'll put a good bit of time into emptying the bin. It picks up quite a lot of debris which is good but you really should vacuum before you run this thing for the first time or you'll be disappointed.If you have 4 rowdy boys and 3 bull mastiffs on a farm, it won't get your floors clean. Nothing will. The money you would spend on this would be better used to hire a cleaning service to do your floors once a month for a year.Remember:Ê Roomba HELPS *YOU* keep your floors clean. It isn't a magical contraption operated by pixies that never requires maintenance or regular inspection. No vacuum is the trouble free device you wish it to be, that's just life, find the option that suits you best and deal with it.For me, this thing is awesome. I love having it and once I learned how to set it up to fit my needs, life has been basically wonderful. I come home and my floors are clean, all I have to do is empty a canister every few days and I'm good to go.I've noticed that it has a little trouble with bath mats, they'll end up bunched or moved entirely but who cares? It's easier to slide a mat back into place than it is to clean the floors myself."

12/28/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Amazing..,"Amazing... not disappointments!Ê It comes with ""light houses"" in case it needs help navigating multiple rooms, but they don't seem to be needed.Ê It runs around all over the house and always finds its way back to the dock to recharge.Ê My wife and I are delighted with this product."
01/10/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Awesome! No more walking home to kitty litter on the floor,"Amazing. Hsve wanted one for years and finally got one for Christmas. Asked for this model because of the cats and all the litter they distribute everywhere. Was starting to get annoyed with coming home to such a mess. Roomba 880 works great! I have a 1400sq ft condo. Front door opens to long hallway... Kitchen opens to the side and then down the hallway opens up to the living room. Litter boxes are in the entry way. Using the two virtual walls/light houses it comes with and setting up ""homebase"" just where the hallway opens up to the living room, the roomba cleans the kitchenÊ and hallway where the litter box is perfectly and returns back to the homebase at the end of the cleaning cycle. It's so great. I purchased another lighthouse/virtual wall to see if it can navigate into the living room as well but worried about the battery running out if I have it do that too... So we'll give it a try... If it runs out I may have to just adjust the lighthouses differently one day to have it just do the living room.Ê Noise is louder than expected but def quieter than my upright vacuumHelpful tip.. If your homebase is on hardwood, I recommend getting those 3M double sided strips to hang pictures or hooks and put them on the bottom.Ê They keep it stable while the roomba goes around or tries to position itself to recharge"
11/23/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,A+++,"Amazing, I can't believe I didn't do this sooner. We have a golden retriever and a lab and they were covering my house in hair.I work full time, go to school full time, have two little boys and a baby on the way. I named her ""Hilga"" the cleaning lady and she gives me so much time back. Worth every penny, and was at my door in two days. Very satisfied."

01/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Amazing little helper!,"Amazing little helper, we have a large dog and one kiddo, needless to say they bring in quite alot of dirt and sheeded hair from the dog. Romba has to vaccum about 1750sqf and it does it more then well, it goes under soffas,Ê tabels and chairs, over carpet to hard floor etc. Where normally you have to lift or move around to get to. There is a few things that it could do better, do 100% of the area, we can see that it missed a few spots, it could be quieter kind of noisy at night and the dustbin could be little larger.Ê And the last thing is that the lighthouse has a limited reach (2.5m), so if you have larger openings between the rooms it sneeks out before the room is fully complete or does not stay in that room....ohh another thing is that the spare parts are cheep."

10/07/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,works great,Amazed how well this works. Wish it could mop the floor too
12/11/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I Definitely Recommend This,"Amazed at how thoroughly the Roomba 880 cleans. Started in a room that looked clean and could not believe that after 4 cycles in one day, it found enough invisible debris to fill the bin each time. Love that it vacuums under our king-size bed! Spinning side brush cleans in corners and around furniture legs where regular vacuums can't! Low sound and slow enough movement does not scare the cat or dogs.Can do something else while floors are being cleaned. Easy to empty and no brushes to clean. It takes time, though--1-2 hours or more per room and then about an hour to re-charge. Plan on using it someplace almost every day to keep up--can't do a quick cleanup when company's coming. Best to move a few things to give it a clear path."
12/18/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Just buy one,Almost a year now and it still vacuums every day for me.Ê I love it.
6/27/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Why did I wait so long to pull the trigger?,"All kinds of awesome.Ê It has a few quirks, but my floors are now always clean.Ê I have two dogs and one is a husky.Ê She sheds like mad.Ê I run it every day and sometimes twice a day.Ê I would recommend getting a soft bumper for it.Ê I had been waiting for the price to lower on it.Ê It finally dropped to $600 and I bought it.Ê I would have paid 800 if I knew it worked so well."
6/17/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Wow wow wow,"All I can say is WOW! And my OCD wife says the same.I bought her this for her birthday this year and we're amazed at how well it does. Even our housekeeper says the floors are cleaner now than when she was sweeping them. She still mops for us, but has cut about an hour off her time here not having to sweep anymore. In fact, the day we got our Roomba was a Friday, the same day our housekeeper cleans. After she left, we ran this baby and were astounded at how much it picked up.We have 100% concrete floors with area rugs scattered throughout. The Roomba has had no trouble getting over and around and even cleaning areas that didn't get cleaned regularly before, under the dressers, beds, ottomans, etc. The key is just emptying it and cleaning it as per the instructions on a regular basis. We LOVE coming home to clean floors!"
9/24/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Well worth every dime!Ê Great little cleaner!,"Ah love!Ê I have finally found a reliable housekeeper!Ê Roberto the Roomba.Ê I have to say I was skeptical, and also $699 hurt- a pricey risk.Ê But wow!Ê Has it ever been worth it!Ê I purchased this after seeing a cat dressed as a shark riding a Roomba video.Ê Frankly, I wasn't really ""in the know"" on robot vacuum cleaners.Ê I thought my house was pretty clean with a once-a-week housekeeper, but ROOMBA seriously takes it to a whole new level of clean.......I have parrots, and they throw their seed husks everyone, so I thought, maybe this roomba thing will help me keep on top of it.Ê Sure enough, yes!Ê The bird disaster area is spit polish cleaned at 11 am every day.Ê Mission accomplished.The BIG SURPRISE, however, is what the Roomba does for the rest of my first floor living space!Ê I have about 1000 square feet of hard wood floorsÊ with intermittent area rugs.Ê Roomba tackles the WHOLE THING.Ê Like other reviewers, I was kind of shocked by how much ""stuff"" was being sucked up on each cleaning.Ê However, we are now about 2 weeks in, and the amount is decreasing.Another surpris is how smart this thing is!Ê He will go underneath furniture and clean it better than it has ever been cleaned, and figure out how to get back out.Ê He goes into all the rooms, finding his ways into pantries and closets if the door is open...cleaning everything. Roomba sometimesÊ ""finds things"" with his sweeper function.Ê TheÊ first week, he ""brought out"" all sorts of things hidden under various pieces of furniture.Ê A random unattached cord, a camera case, an ant trap from 2010, a little raincoat pouch......Roomba has gotten stuck under furniture twice, locked himself in the bathroom once, and got stuck on an floor intake vent.Ê He just shut off and waited til I got home.Ê Otherwise, everyday at 11, he gets to work and re docks himself.This was a great purchase, and I am saving up to get another Roomba for the upstairs."
09/02/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,4,Much cleaner than vacuuming,"After two weeks, I like my new Roomba 880.1) Situation - I have a 6,000 sq foot house with almost all hard wood floors and a hairy Golden Retriever.2) First week - The first week I tried to intelligently move around the home/charging station and the towers.Ê That was frustrating.3) Preparation - I was also busy getting wires/clutter out of the way.Ê I also put felt pads under some tables so the Roomba could get under them.Ê Roomba would get stuck under some tables and I've put junk under the table to block Roomba before getting stuck.4) The second week I put the home charging station in a reasonable spot where Roomba can occasionally find its way home.Ê Mainly now I put Roomba in a room with doors closed.Ê If the room has openings, I'll put a tower or other obstacle (box/chair) in the way.Ê After 30+ minutes, I'll take Roomba to another room.Ê When battery dies, I'll clean it out and charge it up.5) Clean/Filter - I am pretty quick at cleaning the hair out of my Roomba now.Ê I think the new 880 that I have may be much easier than previous models.Ê I'm always amazed at how much hair it picks up.Ê The filter is very dirty.Ê I don't know how to clean it and I don't know if I care.Ê I don't want to start spending money on filters.6) Schedule - I don't use the automatic schedule.Ê Roomba is too noisy to run at night and I like to supervise it somewhat.Ê I try to use it upstairs when the wife is downstairs and vice versa.Ê Plus, in my larger house, Roomba won't find its way home when done.6) Results - My floors are dramatically cleaner than when we vacuumed once/twice a week and picked up the hair balls daily.Ê Amazing to walk around barefoot on the clean floors.7) Roomba is very expensive8) Dogs are VERY expensive - certainly cheapest/easiest choice is to not have a dog.Ê And brushing the dog will help a ton.9) We love our dog like crazy so we are keeping him and the roomba."
1/17/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Meet the new maid at my house.,"After sitting on the fence about a robotic vacuum (and it's cost)we finally bit the bullet and ordered the 880, we have had it for 5 days and I am over the moon in love with it!Ê I have two dogs and one is a Champion Class Shedder, never had a dog that shed this much in my entire life.Ê We have never been able to keep ahead of her hair.Ê We ran the regular vacuum on the day the new Roomba 880 arrived and we have ran the Roomba (from here on dubbed ""The Maid"") every day since then.Ê She picks up an amazing amount of hair and dander, besides my floors (carpet and tile) looking 100% better, and looking better by the day, the level of dust is going down as well.Ê As much as I hate to say this about the cost...worth every single penny.Ê If you are sitting on the fence, jump in...you will be glad you did."
05/02/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,fast and efficient,"After remodeling our home with hardwoods and tile throughout, as most, we noticed the pet hair and dust and every speck of dirt.Ê We read reviews of robotic vacuums and spoke to friends who had roombas and most comments from all sources was good, but...tangles of pet hair, small debris bin, etc...We are VERY happy with the 880!Ê 2 story home so use it upstairs for 3 straight cleanings and the bin filled fairly quickly on 1st 2 cleanings, then it was just maintenance cleaning.Ê Moved it downstairs and same process.Amazed at how quick and quiet this machine is considering the reviews I had read.Ê Our 2 inside pets that shed so much we are surprised they are not bald leave quite a bit of hair about and the Roomba has not tangled once with the new brushless technology.We are thinking of buying another to prevent having to move it up/down stairs.Ê I only wish they made one that cleaned stairs!Highly recommended after a week of service."
3/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"House is now cleaner than it's ever been, especially under queen beds. Dust bunnies are now extinct!","After reading the reviews, I had some concerns, but having used the 880 for a month, I am very pleased. Yes, it is loud, but no more so than other powerful vacuums. Yes, it bumps into things, but with no more force than needed. Yes, the dust bin is small, but if you clean every other day and empty between cleanings, accumulated dust will be low enough that the bin size is fine. (I do wish it gave an alarm in addition to a red light.) Another on-line complaint was stopping at dark stripes in carpets due to the ""stair detection"" system. I have not had that problem. However, like any child or pet, you have to adapt a bit to its behavior. Follow it around a few times during initial use and find places (I had two) where it gets trapped. Move furniture or put a wastebasket or other article there to keep it out. Be careful about ""home base"" and ""lighthouse"" placement to avoid interference and obstacles. Following iRobot's examples, I had the best results by putting ""home base"" along a central corridor wall, which creates a tripping hazard. All things said, however, the house is now cleaner than it's ever been, especially under queen beds. Dust bunnies are now extinct!"
6/15/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Excellent Product But Know It Doesn't Replace Your Vacuum,"After reading many reviews, I purchased this hoping that it would work well enough to reduce the number of times I needed to pull out my upright vacuum. It was clear from the reviews that this product would not replace an upright vacuum, partially due to the lack of suction power, and partially due to a lack of attachments necessary to reach tight spaces. I have a 950 sq. foot apartment with mixed carpet and linoleum flooring and one cat.As expected, this doesn't excel at removing the fine debris in the carpet, due to a lack of suction. However, it exceeded my expectations in its ability to remove pet hair and large debris. I used the Roomba exclusively for a month, and my floors have never been cleaner. When I finally pulled my upright out, I was surprised to find it picked up very little pet hair. It did pick up a moderate about of fine debris, but no more than it would when I was vacuuming with it once a week.The Roomba has allowed me to take my vacuuming down from once a week to once a month. Reducing my time spent vacuuming by 75 percent made this purchase worth the expense. As long has you have accurate expectations on what this product will (manage day to day pet hair) and will not do (replace your regular vacuum), I highly recommend it."
04/05/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,but I am glad I bought it,"After reading all the reviews,Ê I was skeptical, but I am glad I bought it. I have a German Shepherd and two cats. Before getting the 880, I would vacuum 2 to 4 times a day, and always felt like I was losing the battle. I now run Rosie, I named my 880 after the Jetsons, twice a day. This thing gets everything, and I am even having to dust a lot less. I take it up stairs once a week to make sure I get all the house. Make sure you don't leave cordÊ on the floor, it gets tangled up really easily.Ê Also, I find that I have to take the brushes off and pull the hair out of them after every use. All in all, I love it, and it saves me so much time and stress."
8/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,the awesome 880 fixed roomba's long existing flaws!,"After many years and 3 roombas I almost gave up on them. My main issue was the constant maintenance required. Every 2-3 runs I would have to painfully clean brushes and that's a very messy job, with dust and hair flying to your face. And really I dont have much hair at my house, but the carpet really didnt help the brushes. Then after a while the robot would not run quite as well, battery out pretty fast.Well, irobot found the solution!! With the new rubber technology, the 880 did many runs and still looks brand new underneath! I ran it a couple times just a few days after my cleaners came, and it picked up so much crap it was beautiful. I am a convert of irobot again.Definitely put the extra bucks and get the 880, do not get the brushed roombas!"
1/31/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I like it better than Neato Robotics,"After having to return two Neato Botvac vacuums because they arrived damaged and wouldn't work, I finally gave iRobot a try. I am sure glad I did because this vacuum is of much higher quality (it feels that way to me). It cleaned my condo, which has laminate flooring, very well. This vacuum is relatively quiet yet it had no problem picking up cat food and cat litter. I just received this vacuum in the mail and I will update my review if anything changes, as far as durability is concerned."
5/22/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Roomba is no longer just an expensive toy!,"After having the 880 for over a month now I've found that it is easy to use, it cleans under places we normally almost never get and does a rather impressive job.Ê It's not as powerful as a plug in upright or shopvac, but it does a very respectable job of cleaning.Ê I was horrified, then pleasantly surprised when I had to empty the reasonably sized debris bin a couple times when first setting the little creature loose in a room.Ê Apparently it was picking up a LOT of dust and pet hair under furniture we only cleaned under once a year or so."
01/03/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,I bought this beautiful baby. I got it today and I absolutely ...,"After debating for a week about spending $755 (includingÊ taxes), reading all the reviews, asking tons of questions (thanks to those who answered them), I bought this beautiful baby. I got it today andÊ I absolutely love it. I just love it. It works perfect. It is not noisy, not as loud as a normal vacuum winch was very important for me. It was fully charged, easy andÊ ready to use. Did the job on its own, just great. Now, I have only used it twice, I just got it today. I just pray it last for aÊ long time. I can't say enough how happy I am."
04/01/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Very useful and fun to watch,"After being skeptical about Roomba systems for a long time, I decided to take the plunge and go for their top of the line model.Ê I figure if I'm going to jump on the bandwagon I might as well jump all the way.Ê And I am very glad I did.Ê This thing is quite amazing.Ê It wanders seemingly randomly around the house but it eventually gets every where it can and it handles multiple surfaces with ease.Ê Sometimes it gets caught, or it traps itself in a bathroom by closing the door (!) or it continues trying to clean when the bin is full, but overall it makes a significant difference to the cleanliness of the house.Ê Is it the best vacuum in the world?Ê No.Ê Get a Dyson.Ê But my hardwood and carpet mixed floors have never been cleaner now that I run Roomba every couple of days between serious cleanings.Ê The only thing I don't like about it is it should return to its base (or at least stop and scream for help) when the bin is full.Ê And it is a little too loud to run at night while trying to sleep.Ê But I'm glad I bought it and I'd do it again.Ê Also note the light wall devices that come with this package are extremely useful to help keep the little guy where you need it to be.Ê Highly recommended."
7/21/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,"Love, love, love!!!","After an initial hiccup, I totally love this unit, and the iRobot company.Ê I bought this to clean my brand-new ultra-cuishy carpet in my entire upstairs.Ê Sadly, the first unit I received would clean for a couple of minutes, and then stop, saying it was stuck.Ê I called iRobot customer service, and after walking me through some trouble-shooting steps, they sent me a new unit, along with a return label for the old one.Ê I was concerned about this, since I bought the unit here on Amazon, but iRobot provided support with no problem at all.Ê Their customer support people were also extremely polite and helpful.Ê I set the second unit up, and - WOW!Ê I'm in love.Ê I have 2 cats, both shorthair, and neither sheds more than the ordinary house cat.Ê I run my Roomba every few days, and it always ends up full of cat hair.Ê After a week, I have enough cat hair picked up to make another cat!Ê It works great on it.Ê It also goes room to room with no problem.Ê I have the virtual wall/lighthouse units set up, one as a wall protecting the stairs, and the other in a doorway, so that the Roomba totally cleans one room before going to the next.Ê I bought an additional virtual wall/lighthouse for another doorway, so that I can have it clean the whole upstairs.Ê The biggest challenge is making sure all the cat toys are picked up before running it.Ê When a cat toy does get lodged in the roller, again, no problem.Ê The unit is very easy to open up and untangle.Ê The bin is easy to empty, and I love that it has a fine-particle filter.Ê It's never been easier to keep a clean carpet.Ê The only downside, if you can call it that, is that it's so good at picking up pet hair that I need to run it every couple of days, or just be prepared to empty the bin a couple of times during its cleaning cycle.Ê There is a ""bin full"" light on top, so it's easy to see when the bin needs to be emptied.Ê I've read other reviews complaining that the bin is too small, but I don't find this to be a problem.Ê It cleans very well on both carpet and tile, picks up cat hair I never knew was even there, and leaves my entire upstairs clean with very little effort on my part.Ê I have nothing but great things to say about this product, and am very happy with my purchase."

7/31/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Actually exceeded my expectations.,"A few months ago my wife and I bought our dream home - hardwood throughout the main floor and a wonderful walkout basement that opens to a beautiful Carolina backyard for our high-energy terrier to run and play in.Ê Unfortunately the combination of dog, plenty of clay in the backyard, and light colored flooring in the basement den led to a crisis of cleaning.Ê Vacuuming and mopping would keep the room clean for either 3-4 days or until the next rain made fresh wet clay to stick to our dogs paws.Ê Within two months we were sick of having to constantly clean that floor.Enter the Roomba.Ê We've got this baby scheduled to run at 8:15 AM every morning (just after leaving for work) and the floor in our den is cleaner than the day we moved in.Ê Immediately after seeing the fantastic job it did cleaning the den we started putting it to work in other rooms.Ê The first time I ran it in my office (the only carpeted room in the house) I was horrified at what and how much I was dumping out of it's bin after every run - and thankful that this thing is in my corner.My wife was originally very skeptical of getting a Roomba.Ê Now we love our little guy so much that we're strongly considering bringing in a Braava as well for it's wet mopping feature.Ê Worth every penny!"
11/07/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,3,Cliff Sensors STILL glitchy at steps,"[purchased November 3rd at a local retailer, not on Amazon]I've owned 4 or 5 Roombas.Ê The 880 has some nice improvements.Ê It's much quieter than my old 500 series; the dust bin is larger; the suction seems to be better.But there is STILL a major problem with the cliff sensors.Ê We have several rooms with typical steps down, some about 36"" wide, others much wider (""sunken"" living room).Ê Roomba will successfully detect these ""cliffs"" when its approach is angled (not perpendicular to the edge of the step), but if it happens to approach a step straight on (90% to the step), it will tip over and throw Error #6 (""move Roomba and push the clean button again"").Ê This is very annoying and inconvenient.It's amazing to me that iRobot has not fixed this long-standing problem (since Roomba Red!).Ê Customer Service says it's an issue with Roomba's line of sight (infrared beam, I think).Ê When it approaches a step straight on, it cannot detect the edge.Ê And guess who has to get up from her desk and walk down 23 steps to give it a helping hand.Ê Grrr!"
1/25/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,2,High hopes. Big disappointment.,"880 was unable to pick up the dog hair from our area rugs. Worked with iRobot to resolve the situation, but the issue persisted after several different ""fixes"" - we actually had to start using our old vacuum to pick up the hair. After further research, other owners have reported the same issue - the 880 supposedly struggles to differentiate when going from hardwood to area rugs and the mechanism doesn't do its job properly.Hoped this machine was going to live up to its potential, but due to its inability to clean our apartment and the expensive price tag, it was a no brainer to return the unit. Love iRobot as a company, but truly disappointed in this purchase."

08/03/2014,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Expensive but still a value,"8/3/14I read several reviews before making the purchase and I'm glad I read them and glad that I made the purchase.Ê This little guy really gets after things.Ê We have two dogs and one cat.Ê I have it set to run everyday at 11:00AM - mostly when we're out of the house.Ê That makes about 10-12 hours of vacuuming each week.Ê How many more times is that than you currently spend per week?Ê He gets places we weren't getting and has done a terrific job of not getting hung up in extension chords, rugs and the like.Ê When you register the 880 they ask you to create a nick name for your unit.Ê We picked FurVee.Ê Kinda like HumVee but for fur.Ê The name is apt.Ê Generally he runs about 1-1/2 hrs to 2 hrs then docks.Ê Every once in a while he won't make it back to the charger, but it's no big deal.Ê You'll need to tend to him for the first several days (or at least we did) until he can clean your house with one load of debris.Ê Once he max's out, he'll stop.Ê So the first several days we'd watch and have to empty the bin one to three times.Ê Now he can get through the whole house (3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, LR, DR, Den) The weekly maintenance is simple and easy, but is important to be done.Ê Seems to be solidly built and has good senses as to getting around and getting out of things too.Ê Am on week 3 of ownership and can see this around for many, many years.My interest then turned to iRobot's Scooba 450 mop.Ê I read the reviews there too.Ê The 880 is at least the third generation vacuum and it's got most of the issues with the earlier units whipped.Ê It didn't seem that way in the reviews I read for the Scooba.Ê So I'llÊ wait a generation or two to see if the company works out the kinks on that unit too, as I'm sure they will.I would buy it again."

01/02/2016,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,Best household purchase. Makes me more tidy! Millennial family with young child & allergy issues.,"ÊIm the kind of guy who researches everything and reads the manual before turning it on. I bought this on impulse as a present for my wife, without doing ANY researchÊ and I think it is one of the best purchase Ive made in all of 2015.OPERATION:This thing is extremely easy to use. The quick start guide is all you need. I was able to charge it up and then just press the start button without reading anything. I figured out how to clean it, how to use the accessories and how to unclog it without reading anything. Its extremely user friendly.It moved from hardwood to high pile carpet to low pile carpet to vinyl flooring with absolutely no issues and no loss of suction.It gives you audio cues when anything is wrong and it docks itself when it needs to charge or when it detects that its finished. (if it hasnt ventured too far from its home base)Its not whisper quiet, but I can run it in the morning and it does not wake up my wife & daughter.CLEANING:The video Ive uploaded is my actual first experience with the Roomba 880its my first experience with any robotic vacuum cleaner. I literally put it through its paces on camera. If you want to see how it handles getting tossed into a war zone, watch the video.I put it in the middle of the living room after opening Christmas presents. Pine needles everywhere, wrapping paper bits, etc. It went to places the that hadnt been vacuumed since we built this house 5 years ago.It was able to clean about 800-900 square feet of living room, kitchen & hallway on one charge.On a second charge, it was able to do my daughters room and our master bedroom. Im a little ashamed to say but it filled up FIVE times before it finished the master bedroom and ran out of batteries. I had been putting off cleaning under my bed for 4 years, but this thing did it for me. All I had to do was move some junk out from under there and it did the hard work.On a third charge, it cleaned about 1000 square feet of carpeted living room & home office in the basement.It detects dirtier areas and goes into spot clean mode.Ive since read in reviews that it cant clean black carpet but it was able to clean the black carpet in my office just fine, probably because its not jet black, but has specks of blue and grey in it.CLOGS:Ive been running it now for about a week, and Ive only had it clog up twice. Once was because it was running for about 2 hours, cleaning under beds and other areas that we dont ever get to. It sucked up so much hair and loose string, etc, that it tripped the tangle sensor.The other time was because I wanted to let it run over a batch of cords to see how it would handle loose chargers, etc. It grabbed hold of my lightning cable and stopped immediately, displaying a red warning icon and playing an audible message that theres a clog.Without reading the manual, I just flipped it over, pressed the obvious buttons on the bottom to pop off the cover for the 2 spinners, took them both out and the cord came out without any issues. Absolutely no damage done to the cord.SAFETY:The cliff sensors work perfectly, we were very nervous that it was going to drive right off a cliff to its doom, but it handles the edge of the hardwood like a pro.I let it run over Christmas lights, power cords, loose cloths, etc and have not had any safety issues yet.The only thing I would say to be careful of is heavy objects that are precariously balanced. I had it knock a metal Fireplace Screen on top of itself. No damage was done aside from a few scratches to the top.Its pretty gentle on the furniture, when its going at full speed and it hits a chair, it may move it slightly. It ran into the fireplace screen about 8 times before it knocked it over.ACCESSORIES:It comes with an extra HEPA filter, Im not sure when youre supposed to change it, but it got massively clogged up after the first couple of days. I just took an air compressor to it and blew out most of the dirt. Do this outside though, the HEPA catches microscopic allergens and toxins like dust mite fecal matter, etc you dont want to be blowing this stuff in your house or garage.It also come with 2 Virtual Walls and a remote control. Aside from the time I used it in the video, I havent used the remote control since.The virtual walls I use all the time. I havent tried to use lighthouse mode yet, but that is supposed to allow it to find its way back to the docking station from farther rooms in the house.OVERALLAs a young millennial couple raising a small child, my wife and I did not grow up with the clean genes of our parents. We grew up with the internet and nintendo.When we get some down time from work or taking care of our daughter, the first thing we wanted to do was Netflix or Xbox not pick up a vacuum cleaner.The roomba is not only keeping our house clean, but he's like a family pet. My daughter named him Ro-B (Roe-bee) and I kinda dig it.Ive actually ordered some risers from Amazon because it cant fit under one of my couches. I havent been this excited for an amazon package since I bought my Xbox Elite Bundle. I cant believe how much Im looking forward to 8 plastic 1 risers. The roomba is definitely a life changer, and Ive been recommending it to everyone.I really care about the quality of our indoor air, and this combined with my air purifiers is going to make me feel A LOT better about the air that my family is breathing. It was worth every penny."
06/12/2015,iRobot Roomba 880 for Pets and Allergies,5,One word- AWESOME!!!!,"Ruby as we've already come to call our Roomba, is amazing.Ê Best purchase we've made in a long time- keeps the house clean of all the dog hair.Ê The battery lasts a long time- we can actually clean our whole 2500 sq ft house in one charge!Ê Ruby does her thing, then heads back to the dock automatically.Ê All I have to do is empty the dustbin and make sure the rollers are clear, and she's ready to go on her next cleaning adventure.Ê Highly recommended- if you're even thinking about buying one, do it now!"
