2/28/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,You would not believe how well this works
1/12/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Four Stars,You just walk away and it does the rest
12/26/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Awesome love it.,You have to Roomba proof your house but once that is done it is awesome. It's like having a pet that cleans.
8/4/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,Love-hate this vaccuum,"Yes, it's a fascinating, albeit expensive, bit of technology. That said, it is a pain in the butt to clean - every time, if you have the model for pets. Cat hair will clog it in one small room. On the plus side, it gets under the bed, where there could be more pet hair than I care to admit. Can two short haired cats shed faster than Roomba can clean? Will my patience wear out, before my picks, and tweezers and screwdriver? Stay tuned..."
12/22/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This vacuum is fantastic!!,"Years ago I bought one of the original Roomba's and was underwhelmed - it was slow and got stuck in corners.  But I'm lazy at heart, so decided to try again - and this model is amazing!!  First - no problem in corners - it spins and backs out.  (It also has a spinning brush on the side which whisks all those dust devils out of the corner into the vacuum).  Also, it goes easily from carpet to hardwood floor to doormat and back.  If it encounters a cord on the floor, it backs up and comes back in from another angle.  And I know it's weird to think about - how the heck does it figure out your floor plan, especially when it seems to go in random directions?  It all gets down to math, my friends, and the engineers at Roomba worked it out.  We use it for individual rooms (like our muddy utility room), and for entire house runs.  It's great if you have a dog (you wouldn't believe how much dog hair is under your couch).  Easy to clean, easy to set up and definately easy to use.  (You push a button and walk away!)  Great buy."
12/27/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Wow!,"Wow.Wow.  I never knew my floors were so dirty before this!  I've set my ""Room by"" to clean every day.  I am astounded each day when I empty the bin.  Where did all this come from??  I have 3 small dogs and can't believe I've spent years living in what I would now consider gross based on what I dump out each day.  I haven't had to vacuum in weeks!  I am going to get this for my 70+ parents. Best invention ever!!!"
8/17/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Terrible Product - Ruined our Hardwood Floors!,"Wow.. I don't know what to say. This thing worked fine for about a week, then started scratching our hardwood floors in horrible ways across the entire house - by the time we realized it was doing it, the damage was done. The saddest part is that we recently refinished the floors a few months ago (dozens of labor hours + thousands of dollars), so they were immaculate until this horrible robot ruined them. I bought a Roomba back in 2007 for use on hardwoods and it worked fine for years, until it broke - I'm not sure what happened in this case, but it's really sad and definitely will keep me from ever buying one of these again or recommending it to others. The photo attached is only of a small section and doesn't even come close to doing the visible damage justice."
12/28/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Super-impressed by how well it works!,"Wow, wow, WOW!  I wanted to get one of these a few years ago, but I thought that they may just be 'gimmicky' and not work very well.  After reading the reviews a few months ago, I decided that I would take the plunge and get it, as I figured that even if it was just 'ok', it would suffice in between regular vacuuming.  Wow, am I impressed.  We have a pretty clean household and vacuum regularly.  However, the first three times this thing ran it almost filled up the hopper.  It did an awesome job picking up hair and lint that wasn't picked up by our Dyson.  Set it upstairs and the same results -- super deep clean of our house.  I've been telling everyone I know about how well this works -- and as a bonus -- had a friend over for a Christmas party and he said he's had one for 4 years and it's been working great, although his battery is starting to wear down.  But ... if we can have this last 4 years, I'll be thrilled!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
1/19/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,LOVE THIS,"Wow, the Roomba is the best christmas gift I've ever gotten.  I have 2 cats and 2 dogs and vacuumed regularly but there was still so much hair and dust around the house.  Now all I do to vacuum a room is press a button.  I have to empty the roomba every 15-20 minutes while it runs because it picks up SO MUCH HAIR.  Its amazing.  We love this vacuum! We run it all the time and it gets under chairs couches and beds.  Highly highly recommend."
7/2/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Stress is bad; Roomba is great.,"Wow, it changes your life. First of all, after a week, EVERYTHING is cleaner. No tufts of pet fur on the AC vents. No more spot vacuuming behind the entertainment center to prolong electronics life. There's just no more fur. It runs on its daily schedule and gets everything.Dirty homes cause stress. Stress reduces life expectancy. Do yourself a favor; stop pinching pennies because it's just a vacuum. It's not just a vacuum; it's peace of mind."
11/26/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba!!,Wow!! is all I can say. I love it!!
2/12/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,How did I live without this!!?!,"Wow! Now that I don't have to sweep and vacuum up dog hair every day, my life is freed up for activities. But, what will I do with all of this newfound free time? I will have to find some new hobbies, maybe even become Renessaince Festival enthusiast.Seriously though, this little guy is amazing. I have an Australian Shepherd and Dark, Dark, DARK hardwood floors. He sheds like nobody's business,  especially in the Houston heat. I was getting tired of my apartment looking like something out of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly with all of these little 'hairball' tumbleweeds rolling around.Then, this brown box marked Amazon Prime shows up and I open it up to reveal my night in shining armor. A little, round, robotic vacuum that would cure my apartment of this perpetual Wild, Wild West vibe. Buster, as I named my little robot, is amazing. He zips around my apartment everyday at 10am while I am at work and I get to come home to emaculate, clean, HAIRLESS floors! It's a miracle.The 2 minutes of emptying his dust bin that you have to do everyday is nothing compared to the joy he brings you. I HIGHLY recommend buying one of these. You will wonder how you ever lived without it. I also reccomend you attach a mustach or nice hat to him and give him a name."
11/27/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Would not be without one now that I have hardwoods ...,"Would not be without one now that I have hardwoods everywhere. I nicknamed it ""Robo.""  Not very clever, but kind of animates it for me."
1/20/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,A big help!,"Would not be without it again.  The real test will be during  shedding season, for now -it is wonderful!Yippee for me!"

Does what it's supposed except when it doesn'tCons :Won't dock itself hasn't since we've owned it , so we just plug it to charge which means we can't program it to clean on a scheduleNeeds frequent maintenance to keep the side brush clean and spinning . Have had to contact support for one new wheel after the machine would only run in a circleEven after all that I would still recommend it"

2/8/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It's a robot vacuum!,"works well. It is very nice to come home to a clean house. We have dark hardwood floors and have a German Shepherd and two long-haired cats. The roomba is full or hair and dust every day when we get home, but the floors are clean."
1/1/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Happy with its,Works well. Happy with its performance
10/10/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Good substitue for occassional vacuuming,"Works well if you turn it on daily and is probably a good substitute to weekly vacuuming.  It does not outdo a vacuum pound for pound for is definitely a convenience. Not cheap!  It's easy to use and does snag it self too often.remember to clean it often for best results.  However be very very careful if you have liquid messes on the floor.  Check to make sure no liquid soils around. If you don't this will run over any messes and pretty much spread it all over the house, leaving you with a bigger headache than before.  Overall it's tech that is worth getting."
10/14/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Two Stars,Works well but I was shocked when the vacuum was deliver with heaps of dog fur!!
2/5/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,works well
10/20/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,"Works very well, you just need to clean it out after each use."
4/7/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Works great and at a great price,"Works really well! Docks its self almost every time and does a great job cleaning. Needs to be emptied often, but still beats having to vacuum everyday. Has no problem picking up hair from my two dogs."
12/23/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We have all hard floors but it goes over the various rugs just fine. We have two dogs and two cats,Works really well and is much more thorough than I am.  We have all hard floors but it goes over the various rugs just fine.  We have two dogs and two cats.  One of the best things I've ever purchased.
3/27/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Doin the Roombaaaaaa!,"Works like a champ. Does its work and goes home to charge. Very cool product. The dogs don't seem to mind it either. They seem indifferent, the rascals.We have a very dark area rug with a goldish paisley pattern it doesn't like. It gets confused on it and will stop. It thinks it's going over a cliff or something. Other than that it is really rather remarkable. Works awesome on the hardwoods. Collects all the dog hair like magic."
10/23/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Four Stars,Works great. Will get tangled in cords but other than that a great product. My wife loves it.

3/29/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Yep, it really works",Works great. Push the button and head to the store and when you get back your floor is clean. It's a little noisier than I hoped and has trouble getting onto our rug which is why I only give it 4 stars. I wouldn't use it for carpet floors. It docks well and does a great job going around chair legs and corners.

5/8/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great machine,Works great.  My only complaint would be that it is a little big to fit under some furniture bir I guess I just need to pull out the broom and sweep the dog hair out to the open area.
1/1/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Works great. Cleans extremely well picking up fine lint and ...,"Works great.  Cleans extremely well picking up fine lint and dust on hard wood floors and carpet.  Battery life is very good too between charges.  I have not had to clean out the brushes, only empty out the dust receptacle and vacuum the filter."
10/23/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,Works great.
2/25/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,My cleaning wizard!,"Works great, I scheduled it to run twice a week. It learned every inch of the house. I have a labrador and two black cats, it picks up all pet hair. My floors are tile and hardwood and they look great. Make sure to clean out hair and dirt after each cleaning cycle. Great investment."

(First sporadically when I remembered to start and 2 weeks on an everyday setting) and our wheel is broken. Customer service was friendly and did troubleshoot, but very disappointing that such an investment would break so quickly. Really is a game changer in terms of vacuuming if you have dogs, but concerned how long it will last given this problem."
3/29/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,Works great! Would like to own two of them.

5/20/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing!,Works amazingly well. We have 2 dogs and allergies. This vacuum picks up so much more than my upright vacuum and I don't have to lift a finger! I vacuumed with my old vacuum right before I used this one and the amount of dirt it picked up was kind of gross! (Shown in the photo attached) We have been living in filth that we didn't know was there.  It is very easy to maintain and I love that you can schedule a time for it to work. Also it easily goes from carpet to hard floor to rugs without getting stuck. I wish I had purchased this years ago! My cleaning life has forever been changed!

2/20/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Dumb as a brick but gets the job done,"With the exception of the chair/table leg ""spin""  the path finding is dumber than most bots in games, but it manages to get the floor rather clean through sheer persistence."
10/21/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"With 6 dogs, keeping the floors clean was a ...","With 6 dogs, keeping the floors clean was a challenge. The Robot runs every day and has found enough dog hair to knit 3 or 4 more dogs."
1/22/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love this vac,With 4 pets the only downside is I have to empty it a few times as it does the entire first floor of my home.  It really works great and the convenience of only pushing a button every other day to keep control of the pet hair on the wood floors is terrific.
3/19/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,a true hard worker,"With 3 cats at home, this robot has been a lifesaver and a blessing. I program it for 3 days a week, and now I don't spend all weekend cleaning my floors."

12/3/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,The Labs shed like crazy and we always have hair everywhere,"Wish we had purchased a long time ago!  We have 3 indoor dogs, 2 being large Labs.  The Labs shed like crazy and we always have hair everywhere.  It required daily vac/sweeping to keep it under control at all.  The Roomba 650 works great!  We run it every day and it keeps the hair cleaned up.It will not totally replace vacuuming, as the Roomba cannot get under the couch or chairs.  It will run a long time on a charge, but if you are like us and there is a lot of hair to pick up, you will need to stop it occasionally and empty the collection area and brushes.Overall I am thrilled (and a bit mesmerized :-) ) by this product."
10/28/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Wish I had bought years ago!!,Wish I had bought years ago !!
7/3/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,Will change your life forever. You will wonder how you managed without it before.
11/18/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Good gift,Wife loves it.  Got points for this purchase.  Turn it on and leave.  When you get back the room was done and the I robot was charging.
1/6/16,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing,Why I have not bought one sooner? This device is a must have for busy families! It works well and the noise is tolerable. I run it every time we leave the house and it's my little miracle :) I would definitely buy again and probably upgrade to a model that is compatible with the light house
8/15/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,No complaints here!,Why have I not ordered this sooner! This is the best thing ever for my laminate floors. I turn it on almost every morning before I leave for work and come home to nice and clean floors. It definitely saves me a ton of time during the week.
2/5/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It's the best thing since sliced bread,Why didn't I order this sooner?!?! It's the best thing since sliced bread!!
8/15/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Best money ever spent,Who knew there was so much dust and cat hair EVERY SINGLE DAY in  my room?  For the first time  ever I feel like  my room is clean...and with no effort!  I recommend this to everyone.
11/11/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We call it Herbie and we love it,"Who knew a vacuum cleaner would be the best gift of the Xmas season. I'll keep this short n sweet. This vacuum really works well and is super easy to use and low maintenance. Took it out of the box and 2 minutes later Herbie is cleaning the house.. going into corners, under the couch, along all the edges and after about an hour he finds his way back to his docking station, whistles a victory song and recharges himself. It's fantastic!"

9/3/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Glad I finally made the purchase,"While the Roomba isn't perfect, it does a much better job on the floors than I had really anticipated.  It does a good job on my dense, low pile carpets, and easily moves back and forth from hardwood to carpet with no problem.  There are two improvements that would make it perfect. When it moves from bare floor to carpet, there doesn't seem to be enough suction to fully clean the edge of the rug.  I need to periodically go over this area with my small vacuum.  Also, it bumps pretty hard when it comes to a dark colored obstacle.  There hasn't been any damage because of the rubber bumper on the Roomba, but  the bumping is noisy and tends to move things around a bit.  However, these are minor issues and don't detract from the overall performance.  My husband was totally skeptical when I decided to buy the Roomba, but he is now a convert.  I love sitting in my recliner, reading, while my house is getting vacuumed."
4/5/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it so much I bought another and gifted it!,"Where on earth has this product been all of my life???? If you had given be a trial day, then told me it costs $5000, I would be tempted to buy it. I have a pug (shed central!!!!) and a pitt mix (mild shedding) and their hair is no match! I run it about twice a week and only need to mop behind it. Every so often it may miss a small patch on my floor but it hardly ever does. It picks up hair, dirt, and everything in between! Do be sure you clear everything off your floor, it doesn't have hands, and let it go! I wish it were a touch thinner to go under my new couches but it went under my old ones without difficulty. Every so often mine will stop for me to empty the cartridge before continuing, but that usually happens if I use it right after I blow dry my hip length thick hair, and well, you could hardly dock it points for that."
3/12/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,My wife bought it without asking me...,"When my wife showed me what she had gotten I was certain it was a waste of money. I clean the floors in our house, but after shoulder surgery it was difficult. We have wood floors with area rugs and I use an oreck vaccum on all of them. I was amazed at how well this little robot kept the floors clean. It even goes under the furnature to get the dust bunnies I only got once a month. The only problem we have is that once in a while it will get stuck under the kitchen cabinet. Over all I am well pleased with the performance and have had no problems so far."
1/22/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Review for pet owners with HARDWOOD and/or TILE floors,"When I was trying to decide whether or not to buy this item, I poured through the reviews looking for customers that used this only on hardwood and tile floors.  I didn't see any reviews that particularly met this, so I wanted to add this to the plethora of already existing reviews so that people in similar situations would have a helpful review.The big question... does this product work on hardwood and tile floors?  You bet it does!I live in a house that has only hardwood floors in the living and bedroom areas, and tile in the bathrooms and kitchens.  To clean the floors, I would typically have to sweep them, and then mop the the floors with a bissel steam mop.  When you own a dog, sweeping the floors constantly is a must.  The roomba 650 effectively takes sweeping out of the equation.  In fact, using Roomba produces better results than manually sweeping the floors.  You don't have to deal with rogue dirt and debris falling off the end of the bristles.  The result is a perfectly clean floor.I set the roomba to run each night after I go to bed.  I was concerned that he would be too loud, but with the door closed I can barely hear him running around in the other room.  It's a quiet machine.  By running it each night, every morning the floor is clear and free of debris.  Note that you may need to roomba proof the room a little (move a few things to make sure he can get everywhere and doesn't snag loose wires, etc...).By keeping my hardwoods and tiles free of debris, I've noticed that the dirt and grime builds up less frequently and I can steam mop the floors less than I used to.The only downside is that the waste basin is fairly small.  It's easy enough to clear out each time I run it, but I feel like if it stored a little more that the programming feature would be a bit more useful.I haven't had to change the filter, and nothing has gotten tangled in the brushes yet to where I've needed to do in depth cleaning of the roomba itself (though tools were provided for that) and I've had it for about 4 months now.The bottom line is that this has saved me the hassle of having to sweep every other day.  Instead, roomba takes care of it nightly and my hardwoods and tile floors have never looked better.  It has removed SO MUCH STRESS from dealing with them that it's amazing.  If you own a pet and have hardwood or tile floors you want cleaned regularly, this is a MUST BUY!  It's pricey, sure, but it's worth every penny."
10/24/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Every dog should come with one of these!,"When I was given the opportunity to give this little vacuum robot a try I was skeptical that it would clean up pet hair better than the 780 and 770 Roomba models.  Over the past few months I've been pretty impressed with how those Roombas pick up almost all of the dog hair that crosses their path.  So I was intrigued as to how much better the 650 model which is intended for cleaning up in houses with pets would fare.  I set the 650 out on a floor that had previously been vacuumed just to see what it could do.  I was surprised that it completed the cleaning cycle with a bin full of dog hair.  Not to shabby!Set up for the vac is pretty simple.  Just charge it before the first use and hit the clean button to send the little robot on it's way.  It takes our robot about and hour and a half to two hours to clean the second floor of our house.Setting the vac to clean on a schedule is very easy.  The menu is easy to navigate, and making changes to the schedule is simple.The collection container for this vac appears to be slightly larger than the one on the 770 and 780 models which are small. If I run  the Roomba every day and empty the waste collection bin after each run, I don't have any issues with the bin filling up mid-cleaning.  Only when the vac hasn't run for a day do I have an issue with the bin filling up before the robot is done cleaning.  So even with the slightly larger capacity, you'll still want to empty the bin after each use.I've had a few issues with the vacuum getting stuck on things or sucking up things it shouldn't.  If you leave something out with long strings, it can get caught up in the brushes for the vac.  We've had a few instances where the vac has wound it self up on toys with pull cords or clothes that my kids have left on their bedroom floors.  When this happens the vac simply stops.  Unwinding it is easy enough.  Nothing that has gotten caught in the vac has been damaged so I think that's a positive aspect.The 650 robot comes with just one tool for cleaning the brushes while the 770 and 780 models come with two tools for cleaning the brushes and cutting loose any hair that may wind itself around them.  It can take a little bit of time to free brushes, but I found it easier than cleaning the brushes of my upright vacs.  I think it's a shame that the cleaning tool I find to be the most useful is not included with the 650 model.Overall, I'm very happy with the roomba.  It's eliminated the need for me to pull out the vacuum each day.  As a mom with a young baby I appreciate that this little robot saves me about twenty minutes of housework each day.  That's twenty minutes that I can spend with my baby instead of cleaning.Compared with the 770 and 780 models you will note a few differences.  The filter system on the 650 is different.  Instead of two filters you have one larger one that seems like it is made of cheaper materials.  The plastic housing for the 650 feels and looks cheaper than that of the higher numbered models which have a sleeker appearance and nicer materials for their housing. Performance wise they appear to be pretty much the same.  From the bottom of the vacuum, they're essentially the same machine.  As far as I can tell, the only difference is the appearance of the top of the robot.  They all function the same.The higher numbered models carry with them a more substantial price tag.  I don't know if it's necessarily worth spending a couple of hundred of dollars more to get the next level up series.  What I can tell you is you get more spare parts and optional accessories with the higher level series.  With the 650 a virtual wall, two extra filters and a cleaning tool are included.  With the next level up you will find a remote control in the box along with some replacement brushes (quantity and type depends on the model you select) an additional tool and either two virtual walls or two virtual wall lighthouses.One thing that I LOVE about the 650 model is it comes with an actual paper Owner's Manual and quick start guide.  With the 700 series you have to watch a frustrating DVD that doesn't give you half the information that is contained in the Owner's Manual.  Reading through this manual alerted me to the fact that there's a ""Virtual Wall Halo"" (not included) that can be purchased to keep the Roomba from going after your pets bowls.  I had resigned myself to the fact that I either needed to remember to pick up the dog's bowls before I started Roomba or wind up cleaning up puddles from it hitting the water bowl.Overall, the Roomba 650 is a handy vacuum to have. By no means is this little vac as poweful as an upright vacuum, but it certainly does a good job of keeping the floors neat and tidy.  It takes the chore out of cleaning up after your cat or dog."
12/16/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Baby Roomba...,"When I first told my lady that I bought a ""robot vacuum cleaner"" I was in for a little trouble. She thought it was a ridiculous idea and waste of money. After almost a year with the Roomba, she's converted and quite possibly in love with the machine! Apparently its new name is ""Baby Roomba.""The Roomba shipped promptly and arrived with no damage. The packaging was adequate and set-up was a breeze. I scheduled it to run every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8:00am without needing to consult the directions. I've yet to setup the Virtual Wall, but it looks easy enough. It's fascinating to watch it explore the room, although frightening to wake up to on the occasional lazy Friday.It kept my ~900 square foot apartment incredibly clean on its own (I'll admit to vacuuming the old-fashioned way about once every other month) and has only had a few mishaps. It's closed doors behind itself occasionally and been unable to return to the dock. It disagreed with a rubber-band once, but seems to handle bobby-pins with ease.I do a regular maintenance cleaning on it once a month, which might be excessive but I like to keep it clean and healthy. I need to order a new filter and brushes for it soon as well, but that seems cheap enough.All in all, it's been one of my absolute favorite purchases! I have no complaints and hope to add another one to my now larger home soon. If you are on the fence, go for it! It will be the new member of your family :)"
2/14/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Get 1, u will love it","What can I say. Push the button and let it ride.  Def a little loud, so no TV when is on.  I turn it on before I leave."
10/21/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Pet Owners Be Warned - Read this if you own pets.,"What a life saver.  My wife and I own two rabbits.  We usually let them roam around our 2 BR apartment in the mornings and evenings.  Although they are litter box trained, when they free range they tend to drop pellets randomly.  It happens.  Not a big deal as bunny poo is easy to clean up.  But it does get annoying constantly stepping on it, especially when guests come over and you have to vacuum the entire apartment.I got so tired of it that I put down the money and got a Roomba.  What a miracle.  Significantly less bunny droppings.  I run it couple times per week and it works miracles.  The first few times it pulls up a lot of dirt you may not have known you had.  It only gets stuck in one area of  the apt, under an Ikea chair, but I put a pillow under it and that fixes the problem.PET OWNERS WARNING - The first few times I ran this the rabbits were out.  It is a robot and does not care about your pet.  Unfortunately, your pet is not a robot and may care about the Roomba making them move.  In my case my male rabbit's response was to plop down a rather nasty bit of excrement that wasn't the normal hard pellet.  The Roomba also does not care what it picks up.  In this case the pile of wet excrement left by my rabbit got smeared under the Roomba (thankfully missing the brush) and then smeared more on the carpet.  Not a nightmare to clean up but definitely not fun and left a rather unpleasant aroma in the apartment.  If this were a dog or cat I cannot even imagine how much worse it could have been.  Also, google pets attacking Roomba and you'll see quite a few $$$ Roombas chewed to pieces by dogs.  So, before leaving your pet alone with one of these, give it some test runs or you may not like the results."

7/8/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,What a great device to have roaming around your house.
12/20/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba,"Well....its day four in our Roomba household. So far its doing its job. It did get stuck under our fridge a few times. Temporary fix for that is putting some hamburger helper boxes in front so it can't jamb itself underneath. I do believe it is doing a good job at keeping the floors clean. Keep in mind that I have no children and no pets. I bought this model because I have long hair and shed quite a bit. Hoping that this model will be able to deal with it. I didn't really find the noise all that bothersome as others have mentioned in other ratings of this product. Also...super easy to setup. Basically took it out of the box, pulled the battery tab, charged it, and sent it on its way!"
5/12/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Get's the floor... a little cleaner?  Leaves lots behind,"Well, I bought this after reading a lot of positive reviews and have to say I'm disappointed.  It does fill up with a lot of lint and dirt after each cleaning, but the hard wood floors just don't look vacuumed at all.  There are tiny pieces of grass, crumbs, etc left when it has finished that stick out like a sore thumb.  If I have to vacuum after my $450 robot vacuums, then why have it?  I'm going to try to return it.  Not sure how that works.  I'll try to remember to update and let you know."
11/26/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,WORKS EXTREMELY WELL AND I LOVE IT.,WELL WORTH THE PRICE.  WORKS EXTREMELY WELL AND I LOVE IT.
11/3/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Worth the $$ if you have a busy home!!,"Well worth the price!!!!!! I could not keep up with all the sweeping behind two dogs and my 4-yr-old without this thing. We even named it, ""Shirley"". (We were always saying, ""surely, it's vaccuumed the bedroom by now.."")"
12/11/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Much better than the older models,"We've owned and used several iRobot vacuums throughout the years. The first one we purchased had a very small dirt bin and was basically a toy or novelty item. The second iRobot we purchased was the Pet model which was supposed to work like the iRobot 650. While the older Pet model worked pretty good, the newest model is a great improvement. The 650 has a larger dirt bin making the vacuum far more useful as the robot actually cleans rooms without too much maintenance. Maintenance seems a bit easier too as I was able to quickly disassemble and reassemble the 650 for cleaning. It helped that iRobot has included onsite videos showing how you can take apart and clean the iRobot vacuum.I do wish iRobot had included both the circular brush cleaning tool as part of the 650 cleaning kit. You will receive the ""comb"" used to remove hair from the brushes as part of the cleaning kit.We have yet to decide a name for the the 650 as we are debating between Dr. Susan Calvin (one of the fictional robotists featured in Dr Asimov's robot books) or Daneel who was a robot detective  in Caves of Steel written by Asimov. I am leaning towards Daneel as the 650 is really good at seeking out dirt and removing it.Recommend."
1/4/16,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great for those with little time!,"We've nicknamed our little Roomba ""Remy"" as we think that he's funny roaming around our apartment.  Our apartment is pretty small (only a couple hundred square feet) and it seems to get to every inch.  We have set him to run every day while we're out and we always come back to a sparkling apartment.  Most days we find Remy back on its charger, however, there are instances where it gets stuck.  Most often we find him under our couch where it manages to get under, but is unable to get back out.  We might also find it in our bathroom where it has been stuck behind a floor rug that has bunched up behind him.  We do empty the trap every day, but that's mostly because we have a rabbit that sheds like the dickens and his hair fills up the trap pretty quickly.  Otherwise he does seem to suck up all the dirt, fur and hay that lines our floor.  I've been very happy with this Roomba and would definitely recommend it."
9/18/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Why did I wait so long to get this?,"We've had this running about two months, 3-4 times a week. It works great not only on the carpet but the wood floors as well. I haven't seen any issues on the legs of furniture as mentioned by others and the cleaning and maintenance couldn't be easier."
10/13/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Don't bother,"We've had this roomba for 40 days, it already broke and isn't eligible for return. Don't waste your money."
12/1/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,3 years of love!,"We've had this robot for almost three years! I don't know how we ever lived without it! We have 3 small children, 2 dogs and a cat, we have high foot traffic and roomba cleans better than if I did it myself except I don't need to lift a finger. I set the timer for it to clean before we wake up everyday. Although, we probably run it more than that, set it to clean when you go shopping and come back to clean floors. You need to love your roomba back though. First, if you have kids, you have to name it. My kids named ours Ruby. We empty ruby's contents everyday and give her a deep clean once a month. Every few months we replace the spinner and filter parts. When her battery wasn't holding well, it was an easy Amazon purchase, $20 for a battery, plug in and good as new! I like that we can do all of the maintenance ourself since we are a DIY family. We've used ruby so much now that the tread on the wheels have warn down completely and we are finally retiring her to a different floor and bringing in a fresh new roomba that we've promptly named Zumba. Roomba isn't without a few quirks though. It's best to do a walk through before running and pick up anything that would get stuck in any normal vacuum, such as shoelaces, clothes, etc. We had a chair that roomba would always get stuck on, so we would have to pick it up every evening. Dirt and grim builds up on the sensors, so it won't run and dock as well when dirty, like I said, you have to love your roomba back."
5/3/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love this little sucker!,"We've had this for a week and scheduled it to run every day last week after my wife and I left for work. We have about 2000 square feet of hardwood downstairs that felt dirty the whole week after sweeping on Sundays. The Roomba, which arrived on Sunday luckily, worked right out of the box but I restrained myself from using it and let it charge fully, which took about an hour for the light to go from orange to green. I ran it 3 times that day and was amazed how much dust, cat hair and relatively large ""things"" the Roomba picked up. There was a full cat's-worth of hair in there every time I ran it and this continued for about 3 days. On Thursday I could tell we were getting into the maintenance phase since there was only a small mouse's-worth of cat hair in the bin...Friday even less.When I first setup the charging base I put it in our living room which is kind of enclosed by our couch. I watched as the Roomba made its way through the entire downstairs but I noticed it really loved our open dining room and kitchen most of all so I decided to relocate the charging base to that area so I wouldn't come home to find it stuck in there with a dead battery. I was a little worried about all the reviewers talking about how the Roomba would get stuck under dining room chairs. The Roomba does have a tendency to spend a little more time than I would like trying to escape the confines of our dining room chairs. I'm guessing the Roomba is programmed with mathematical equations that determine the angle at which it should turn around and go when it hits something and usually it works very well when faced with a wider object but since chair legs are very narrow it spends a lot of time turning around and hitting the other chair legs. After a minute or so of playing bumper cars however it always makes it out.One thing I really love is the wall hugging feature. It knows when it finds a wall and cleans along the whole thing. Then it bumps into the next wall, determines the angle it needs to turn to continue going straight and does so. The Roomba seems to have some randomization programmed in it as well though since it gets bored of doing the same thing for too long and decides to do something different just to keep the cleaning process exciting. If it goes straight for too long it will decide to turn around and go the other direction, usually parallel to the last path it traveled like if it was mowing the lawn. If it finds a particularly dirty spot the little dirt sensor light will flash and it will spiral around the area for a few spins to make sure that area is picked up.The docking feature is cool. When it's time to go home, either by it sensing a low battery charge or by you pressing the dock button, it will crawl back onto its charging base if the sensor on the Roomba ""finds"" the sensor on the charger. If there is a weakness to this ""dumb"" Roomba then this would be it. Since the homing feature is limited in range to about 8-10 feet I would guess and the 2 sensors have to be in sight of each other the Roomba doesn't really know where to go when it's time to charge. As I initially said we placed the charger in the living room and when the Roomba started flashing the dock button because the battery was getting low and began searching for its base, it happened to be cleaning our dining room at the time. I hopefully cheered it on as it searched for the charging base but it seemed to always go the wrong direction. I really couldn't tell if there was a difference in the pattern it took while searching for its dock vs its normal cleaning pattern. After about 10 minutes of wandering through the dining room I got sad for the little thing and brought it into the living room. When it got about 8 feet away from the dock sensor it paused and started zig-zagging towards the charger and when it got a few inches away it slowed down and crept perfectly onto the 2 contact points. Since relocating the charger to our dining room the floors have been spotless and the Roomba has been happily sitting in its base every day when I come home, silently begging me to empty its full stomach of floor yuckies.You wouldn't think saving 15 minutes of sweeping a week would make this thing worth it but my wife would disagree with you. It's probably not just that but knowing the floors are clean every day when we come home and seeing how much stuff it picks up. Happy wife happy life I guess.CONS:If your floor plan is large and intricate the Roomba may be unable to find the docking station when it's time to chargeThe front bumper will get scuffed very quickly***Though it does detect that it's about to run into something and slows down to minimize the impact and the damage is only superficial.The cleaning pattern is very random***It may completely skip the room it started in and clean the next room 3 times but it seems to eventually make it everywhere.It can only be scheduled once a day and won't continue after a charge***This is only a problem if you NEED it to clean everything right away. It may clean 1 room 5 times, skip another room and need to charge and once it does that it will not clean again until the next day. You could manually schedule it again if you wanted to or kick off an unscheduled cleaning by pushing the CLEAN button anytime.You'll feel like a fancy pants but you won't carePROS:It picks up the dirt you see and the dirt you didn't know was even thereIt knows when it's about to hit something***When it senses an object in front of it it slows down considerably. If it's really narrow like a dining chair leg it may not sense it in time though.It tells you about its problems***If something goes wrong it tells you so. I found that out when I picked it up while it was cleaning and a nice lady voice told me to bugger off and let it finish or something like that. ;)The scheduler is great***We programmed it to clean every weekday at 10am and it sticks to it. (See CONS)It's easy to empty***The back bin pulls off easily with one press of a button and is easy to dump in your trash. Pet hair will tend to stick to the filter so I just pull that off in 1 or 2 clumps. The filter comes out simply and I usually bang it a few times on the trash can to clear the dust. The 2 bottom brush wheels come out with the press of 2 little spring clips and the larger of the 2 will need to have long hairs untangled from time to time. A tool that looks like a letter opener comes with the Roomba for this purpose.It's powerful but quiet***It has a very powerful sucking motor but it's much quieter than a regular vacuum.Your days of sweeping or vacuuming your hard floors will be over***Honestly the Roomba sweeps better than we ever have so we have gladly given up those responsibilities. We haven't used it on our upstairs carpet because we don't want to so I can't speak on its abilities there. With our new and thick carpet however I would imagine the brush and bin would be full after 5 minutes with carpet pieces so that would be counterproductive anyway.UPDATE almost a year laterIt's still going strong. It runs 5 days a week M-F while we're at work and we haven't had to sweep with a broom once since we got it. I usually empty the bin on Wednesday and then again on Sunday. We could probably empty it only once a week but it's pretty darn full after 3 days so I feel better not making the motor work extra hard. When we ordered this it came with a free bonus pack with an extra filter but honestly I don't think it will ever need it. Every few months I run some water through the filter and it looks brand new again.It sweeps our entire downstairs which is about 1700 square feet of faux hardwood vinyl. It has only gotten stuck a few times and not made it back to its docking station but it's been my fault most of the time. Usually it's because it'll run over a sock or suck up my shoe lace and it turns itself off if the roller can no longer turn. It has shut itself in our guest bathroom a few times as well. If you let it in a room with a door that opens in, there is a good chance that it will push the door closed and eventually run out of power in there. The good news is that the room will be spotless.My wife and I agree this is our best purchase ever."
10/23/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Very good, but consider the Roomba 880 instead.","We've had several different Roombas over the years, including this model, and even a few competing products from other companies.  With almost all of them, including this Roomba 650, the cleaning that they did and the convenience that they provided has been wonderful and improved with each new model.Despite they constant progress, the effort required to clean the brushes out was the one flaw that always made us wonder if vacuuming robots were even worth the cost and time.  Because we have two dogs that shed a lot, we've always opted to accept having to spend 15 or 20 minutes each week cleaning the hair out of the brushes, especially since that brush cleaning has gotten slightly shorter and easier with each new model of Roomba.The Roomba 880 has largely solved the hair in the brush issue.  Its new design is dramatically better than previous ones, including this 650, both in getting the hair into the bin, instead of onto the brushes, and making it easy to remove the hair that does end up on the brushes.This robot is great, but we recommend that you consider the 880iRobot Roomba 880 Vacuum Cleaning Robot For Pets and Allergies.  It is worth the extra cost if you don't want to spend a bunch of time each week cleaning hair out of the brushes."
9/12/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Perfect for fussy folks like us,"We've had ours for a year this month. We just love not having to sweep anymore.THE ROOMBA IS FOR YOU AS LONG AS:1. You have no tall (higher than Berber-height, that is) carpeting.2. You have no young kids that naturally spread toys/debris all over the floor...or are willing to pick everything up before letting the Roomba do its thing.3. You have a good spot to put the charging station...for example, under a china cabinet where it's not going to get stepped on, yet visible enough to the Roomba to ""find"" it when it's done.4. Everyone is able to leave the ""work area"" for an hour or so when the Roomba does its thing.OUR ENVIRONMENT:Our home is about 2/3 tiled and 1/3 Berber carpeting. We have 2 boys, 8 and 5, and a rat terrier.WHAT WE DO BEFORE THE ROOMBA DOES ITS THING TO ENSURE SATISFACTION-We sweep the floors of each linen/hall closet, kitchen pantry, as well as our 1/2 bath, and close all said doors. The stuff we sweep we simply sweep ""out"" for the Roomba to subsequently pick up.-We move all 6 dining chairs (upside down, ""school style"") on top of the dining table. This helps to allow the Roomba to move freely about, without moving back-and-forth repeatedly around chair/table legs, which drains battery life and causes missed spots due to the Roomba not being able to fit between chair/table legs.-We move small items, i.e. trash cans/dog ""beds"" onto tables/counters.WE LOVE THE ROOMBA BECAUSE:-It's PERFECT on hard floors, because there is virtually zero dog hair/crumbs/whatnot left, including by walls that one sometimes overlooks when sweeping.-The hard floors are cleaned more-often (by virtue of the Roomba making it much, much easier for us) and as a result need to be mopped less frequently.-The bottom of our feet stay cleaner (we leave our footwear at the door).-We appreciate walking across clean, debris-free hard floors; in the pre-Roomba days when we'd get busy with life and couldn't sweep/vacuum for a week or two, we felt ""forced"" to finally clean up when we got sufficiently annoyed by walking on dog hair/small debris. No more. If you like the ""clean, recently-swept floor feel"" under your bare feet, Roomba is exactly what the Dr ordered.-It vacuums under all furniture taller than 4"", including our master bed, eliminating the need to remove our mattress to finally vacuum under the bed, which we frankly only did every 6 months or so. Yuck no more.-It vacuums the carpeted (bedroom) areas well, though being a battery-operated machine, it doesn't have the powerful suction of a conventional vacuum cleaner; thus, we agree that it probably wouldn't do well with especially-tall carpeting.THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:-Wires need to be arranged so that none of them dangle on the floor where Roomba goes. We did this by arranging them behind furniture, and raising our phone/tablet charging wires onto the end table when about to ""Roomba"".-Having kids, we don't program our Roomba, knowing they scatter toys; we therefore have them clean up first and then manually ""start"" Roomba when ready.-In the boys' bedrooms we have them place all ""loose"" floor stuff (desk chairs, floor decor, toy containers and so forth) on their own beds so Roomba can move freely about across their respective floors.-As other reviewers have said, have patience. It takes time for the Roomba to work its magic. If it misses a spot or doesn't pick something up, be patient and don't judge it by a single pass over a given surface. On its subsequent passes, it'll pass over the same spot from various directions so whatever it missed WILL get picked up.-It DOES work well on non-tall rugs/carpeting, by virtue of passing over the same given spot repeatedly and from different directions. The bin in our Roomba, for example, gets full (mostly dust and dog hair) after doing our master bedroom after only a few days since the last vacuuming, whereas gets less-full after doing the guest bedroom where no one sleeps on a regular basis.BOTTOM LINE:Yes, it's expensive. But, if you have largely hard floors and non-tall carpeting, walk barefoot at home and are fussy about having clean hard floors to walk on, the Roomba is your long-lost best friend."
9/19/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Pretty neat!,"We've had our Roomba for about 2 months now and we use it once, sometimes twice per week. We have two dogs (greyhound and maltipoo) who don't shed too badly, but the fur can accumulate pretty quickly (our house is all tile so you will see it blowing across the floor like a tumbleweed) so we decided to get this to help in between cleanings. This is pretty amazing to watch in action, or at least it is to me. The Roomba really is a smart product for the most part. it gets into so many nooks and crannies that I struggled to reach before (e.g. under the bed, nightstands, armoire, etc.) It usually picks up on where walls and ledges are and carefully navigates around them, although it has banged into the wall on occasion. When in operation, this thing can be pretty loud, but not much louder than a regular house vacuum. I have to say, I was really amazed at the amount of fur our Roomba picked up! I had no idea there was even that much around! But, I did witness it go over dirt a few times and not pick it up, so it's not 100% effective. Regardless, it does exactly what we need to and helps keep our floor clean between normal house cleaning so it has been a great purchase for us. I haven't used the barriers or scheduling program so I can't comment on those."
1/11/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Convenient and Fun, but not perfect","We've had it for about a week, and here's our thoughts so far:Pros:1) Easy to set up, from unboxing to first scheduled run takes as little as a couple of minutes.2) As a regular maintenance vacuuming device, it does a quite decent job.  It doesn't have the suction power of a regular vacuum cleaner, but it compensates with easier operation and more frequent runs.3) When the battery runs out, it's smart enough to return to the dock and recharge.  Even when the dock is in a separate room with many turns away, the vacuum had no problem finding the base.4) It can be quite entertaining to watch this robot run around.  No kidding.  And my family (dogs included) aren't bothered by the noise at all.Cons:1) Range is limited.  The robot can run for a little over an hour on each fully charge, and it will run in a rather random pattern during that time until the battery dies.  In other words, if you have a smaller house, the vacuum may cover 100% of the space, more than once at certain places even.  But if the house is big, it will likely miss many places.  But as mentioned above, the vacuum will probably cover the missing spot on a separate run. Probably.I know some of Roomba's competitor uses different technology and alogorithm to map the room and plan the routes, some run in the fashion of a lawn mower, which is probably more efficient than Roomba's ""random"" bump and turn method.  But I kind of like Roomba's way bc with limited suction power, it probably does take a couple runs to pick up all the dirt.  With that said, I do wish the battery capacity can be increased a little and the range be extended."
8/28/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great robot vacuum,"We've had it for 8 months now and it's still working great. Only has gotten stuck 3 times and vacuums every day on the scheduler. It gets completely full with pet hair every day from our two dogs. It misses some spots, but fits in most places. I wish the canister was bigger to hold more, but other than that it is great!"
6/15/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Replaced our 550 with the 650-much better!,"We've been using our Roomba 650 for about 6 weeks now and so far, it's working great!I got the 650 from a well-known home shopping channel using flexpay to replace a model 550 that, after almost 4 years, had begun not finding its station & wasn't picking up particulates like it used to. The 550 would also stop and announce it was time to ""clean Roomba's brushes"" when there was barely any debris in the brushes or the bin. I had even taken off the bottom of the Roomba & cleaned the brass sensor under the brushes thoroughly, but it didn't help.The 650 looks almost identical to the 550 from the outside, but the dirt bin has a small motor or fan inside that apparently pulls in/vacuums up more pet hair/dirt/etc. because the bin gets full!I automatically check the bin once or twice a week because it has yet to announce that it's full or that the brushes need to be cleaned.The 650 also has the updated Roomba brushes with the bigger yellow end caps. These brushes clean much better and the end caps are much easier to deal with when cleaning than previous Roomba brushes.The 650 has ended up picking up an occasional dryer sheets & small pet toys without stopping. I'll discover them when I check the bin.The only teeny, tiny downside is that the Control Station/remote (white) that I used with the Roomba 550 apparently will not work with the Roomba 650. I tried getting the two to communicate/pair but they wouldn't. I really like that Control Station better than the remote that came with the 650. The Control Station allows you to not only operate the Roomba, but to program it as well, should the Roomba get stuck somewhere in the house allowing the battery to drain, thus losing the on-board schedule. That being said, the 650 hasn't done that yet, like our 550 used to.Overall, VERY pleased with the Roomba 650.>^..^<"
1/6/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Surprisingly effective at keeping floors clean between full vacuuming sessions,"We were skeptical that this little gadget could actually do a good job getting our carpet and tile floors clean, but we have been pleasantly surprised. I am not sure who is more fascinated by watching the Roomba do its job - the humans in the household or the cats.The dirt cup can hold a fair amount of debris before it needs to be emptied and I'm always surprised at how much it has picked up while it's rolling around the house. It has definitely kept our floors cleaner than they would have otherwise been between full-on vacuuming sessions."
12/23/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Roomba vs, Samoyed dog hair.","We were a little hesitant in making this purchase initially since our cleaning challenge is that we have 2 very hairy Samoyed dogs. Prior to Hazel (we call our roomba Hazel after a maid on an old TV sitcom) we used our central vac system almost daily. Now we let Hazel clean the whole first floor of our house daily and after 2 months we are still amazed how much she collects. Every day the bin is full of superfine Samoyed hair. Hazel is a huge time saver since she is so thorough at cleaning in all of the corners and under things. With all of this fine dog hair (Samoyeds have hair up to 10"" long)  floating around it is necessary to clean the brushes every other day but I find with the circular brush cleaning tool it is a relatively quick process.So if you have a hairy dog or cat problem consider a roomba as a first class hair collection tool."
5/28/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We use this daily and it makes a huge difference ...,We use this daily and it makes a huge difference compared to standard vacuuming. I think the carpet is much cleaner than with the once a week schedule we had before.
7/13/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It's our new Pet!,"We use our Roomba to help out around the house even though we do not have a pet we do have two toddlers and a carpet that likes to shed.  We hide the charging station partly under the couch for easy access. We use it a few times a week in a multiple room loft area and it does a good job between full vacuuming on the weekend. You can easily schedule it, leave the house and have it clean up while you are away.  So far absoutely no issues, still cleaning as well as Day 1."
4/4/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it!,"We spent the first 30 minutes just watching it work!  Good to have to use on a daily basis, but there are some things it won't go under."
12/21/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Our 2nd Roomba,"We returned a roomba few years back because the brushes kept breaking, this one we purchased about two months back and brushes are holding strong!"
9/29/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Never thought I would love it!,"We recently had new flooring installed in two levels of our tri-level home (~1,500 sq ft):  living room, dining and kitchen are now dark wood plank LVT, lower level family room is dark LVT + large area rug. Upstairs is carpet in bedrooms/hallway, vinyl in bathrooms.  We originally had a mix of carpet and vinyl in the house (beige and light-medium oak parquet-look vinyl).My nightmare began with the new ""dark"" flooring.  It never looked clean with 3 adults in the house and 3 dogs (2 cocker spaniels and a cockapoo).  The dogs don't shed much but they are always bringing something in from the yard--leaves, grass, oak tree whirlybirds, dirt, mud etc (as is my spouse), and there is all the crumbs from normal cooking and eating etc.  I now needed to sweep/vacuum and/or wet/dry mop daily instead of once a week.  I first tried the Braava to dust mop the LVT.  The Braava did okay, but it got stuck a lot under several chairs that had rocker bases and the wet mop always had too much hair etc in it so I needed to dry dust mop once and wet mop the next even if I used my stick vac first.  I work outside the home at least 5 days a week, long hours and a long commute.  I didn't need this extra work.On the spur of the moment I decided to buy the Roomba 650 (or 655) at Costco as they had it on display.  I never thought I would buy a Roomba (or the Braava).  This has made life so much easier.  After less than a week (bought Sat), I have sent the Roomba on at least one mission each day.  On the main level daily, lower level once as a trial (LVT, area rug, scatter rug), and the upper level twice.  Now that I see what it can do and what needs to be watched, I'm ready to start using the schedule cycle for main level (Roomba base) when I get up in the AM (set for 4:00 am M-F, weekends later) and I'll manually set to do a clean in the other two levels alternating days.  The only time my Roomba has gotten stuck so far is at the stair transition and only the one time.  It doesn't like the scatter rug in the kitchen where the dog bowls are (it bunches it up, but doesn't get stuck). I knew enough going in that I had to do some preparation with cords etc.  When I replace the scatter rug, I'll be looking for one that's heavier and will work better with the Roomba. The scatter rug and area rug in the family room (lower level) didn't cause any problems.  I may be thinking of some different furniture placement so the Roomba can get into more areas of the family room.  Still working on the dining room for maximum efficiency, we have a pedestal table.  The Roomba can't get under the pedestal part as it's too low and if I straddle the chair's on the pedestal legs it takes a lot of time for it to work on that room.  Plan to try various ways to place the chairs (upside down on the tabletop, move between the table legs, move away from the table).  I will move the table and a few other furniture pieces around slightly a couple of times a week that are too low for the Roomba to get under.I still use the Braava, but now it's the default wet mop several times a week in the evening as it needs to be babysat.I think I have the perfect pair now."
11/23/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Adorable time saver,"We received this product as part of our Amazon wedding registry and he's honestly become my favorite gift. My wife immediately named him ""Mr. Bumble"" and it's fitting. He's not only black and yellow but also bumbles around adorably vacuuming the house. We have an open floor plan so it's pretty easy for him to go around our first floor cleaning the kitchen, living room, and mud room.We love cooking but don't always like having to sweep up after every night's errant bits/crumbs. Mr. Bumble manages to keep things very tidy by regularly vacuuming without us needing to do much more than spend 2 minutes moving our coffee table more into the open to clear the way, empty his bin, and hit the ""clean"" button.Pros:Handles carpet transition wellrelatively quietautomatic schedulingdoes his thing and has thus far always managed to get back to his dock to recharge without any helpdumping out the bin is quick and painlessVery little ""tidying"" required before he runsEdit: I've added some pictures of how much debris the little fellow can pick up on one run through what looked like a relatively clean areaCons:Suction power is a little lower than idealsometimes misses a few small bits in one pass (although he seems to compensate by getting things on a second pass/run)One does have to dump out the bin occasionally and move a few things out of the way to ensure a good cleaningWe love the little fellow and if you think you'd benefit from some easy regular maintenance cleaning then we'd highly recommend this Roomba."
11/29/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,still a game changer,"We received this as a gift and I am thinking about getting it for my father-in-law so was humoring myself reading the reviews. I have started to take it for granted but when we first got it, I loved it SO much I thought we should name it like a pet. I still love it. We have stopped vacuuming in the traditional sense we have a large dog and 2 boys and I can't even imagine the apocalyptic nastiness that would commence without this device. That being saidIT IS indeed a vacuum cleaner.... so anything you would have to do to prepare to run a vacuum you have to do with this thing... picking up large debris such as discarded socks etc. We habitually put our chairs up on the table like a restaurant at the end of the day when this thing is running you don't have to do that but it super annoying to watch it navigate 16 chair legs. Actually I never thought to put my chairs up before before I moved them out of the room... definitely a better way to clean your floors with or without this thing. We got this last year and have run it daily since then I would say we are a heavy traffic family and not super diligent with maintenance beyond just cleaning the trap daily and occasionally removing obstructions like plastic or string and it still does a great job. The only caveat I can think of: We have hardwood floor or tile throughout we have several area rugs and one that has a large black border and black throughoutthis thing will not work on itit sees black as a drop off which prevents it from going down stairs etc. so we manually vacuum that particular rugper the Internet I have tried taping the sensors etc but that does not work. it's still genius on anything that is not black."
1/28/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it,We received ours just before Christmas about 2 months ago and really like it so far.  With a dog a couple of cats and a kid it really keeps up with the hair on the floor allowing us to sweep 1 time/week in the hard to reach areas instead of the entire floor daily.  We have wood and tile throughout with a few area rugs and it seems to deal well with all surfaces.  I can't believe that the bin fills up every single day so make sure you keep it dumped and maybe use the regular vacuum to clean the filter a couple of times a week.  Ours must have been on sale because we paid much less than the $399 it advirtized at now.
10/10/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Battery charging,"We received our iRobot in late July. It worked wonderfully until 2 weeks ago and quit charging, Ant suggestions??"
12/8/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We really like that it can run on a schedule,We really like that it can run on a schedule. We have it run while we're at work so we don't have to hear or avoid it. When we come home we empty the bin and it's ready for the next scheduled run. Our home is fairly large so we use the included virtual wall to split it's duty cycle. This little guy has no problem cleaning each side of the house on a single charge.
11/2/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We love our Roomba 650!,"We read tons of reviews before buying our Roomba 650 Vacuum. I was a big skeptic. BUT now I'm a believer and obsessed with our Roomba! It can travel over rugs, hardwood, and door frames no problem! It goes all around and really does vacuum up a lot!! The best part is is that it saves me so much time because I don't have to vacuum!"
11/24/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Did not perform as expected with pet hair/,"We purchased this unit specifically because it claimed it was for pet hair.  It did not meet our expectations.  We have a combination of wood floors and low rugs.  The unit did well navigating the rooms and was able to vaccum the pet hair in modest amounts.  It vacuumed best when the hair was in the middle of the room and of light quantity.  However, it did very poorly when the hair was around the edges of the room near walls and doors.  It was at its worst when the hair was next to rugs.  It seemed if there was any tension keeping the hair to the rug or other object, the unit could not pull and vacuum the hair.  In hindsight we probably should not have been surprised.  The unit does not have the power of a regular vacuum cleaner and one should not expect it to perform as well.  We didn't expect to be able to get rid of our normal vacuum cleaner but wanted to keep things a bit more tidy in between big cleanings. This unit did not meet that need.  Finally, even if it performed as marketed, the unit takes an excessive amount of time to clean just one room-- not to mention multiple.  While the noise of the unit isn't bad, it is not something you want to hear for hours.  Some would argue that one should turn the unit on when you leave the house, which would be logical.  However, this is not practical given the unit will always shut down at some point and request that the sensor be cleaned and the bumpers cleared."
8/30/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,AMAZING!,"We purchased this Roomba on Friday at Best Buy! We have named him Walle! This little guy is the best thing to come into my life, the setup is pretty simple, you have to leave it charged overnight at first. The next day we turned it on and after about 30 minutes I did have to empty, but please note I never swept my house so it was a dirty, but you could see the difference! The best part about this guy is he's able to go under your couch/bed/or hard to reach places, which is a huge bonus! I don't know how he would work with carpet, but he has some really great wheels, so it shouldn't be a problem. Honestly, the only thing I could complain is that it didn't also Mop the floors as well."
12/21/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Totally worth the money,"We purchased this in the summer of this year. We have it set to run everyday. Our house is wood flooring, and we have two cats. This picks up litter, the little pet hair ""tumbleweeds"" and other little bits of dust and debris on the floor. You just have to remember to empty the container each day at first. When it first starts cleaning, you will amazed at what you haven't seen on your floor. It does not clean the whole house each time: one day it will do one area (living room, bedroom, hallways) then the next day it seems to go in another direction (kitchen, dining, master bedroom), which is fine with me, we don't need all over daily cleaning."
3/20/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Best money I ever spent,"We purchased the Roomba 650 to handle day-to-day cleaning of hardwood floors.  Not only has the Roomba far exceeded our expectations for the hardwoods, it has also exceeded them on carpet.You know the Roomba is working because you will need to repeatedly empty the bin to toss all the debris it picks up from the floor.  We set it loose in a master bedroom, and within an hour we had perfectly clean carpet, that was fluffy and soft to the touch, even under the bed.  There is nothing better than watching a robot do your housework for you, in fact, I coined a term to describe the feeling, and it is ""housegasm.""I cannot recommend the Roomba 650 highly enough.  We have two small puppies who shed hair; the Roomba gets it all.  We live in the Pacific Northwest and cannot help tracking pine needles into the house; the Roomba gets them all.Coming home to clean floors every day is a great feeling.  Thank you Roomba 650!"
1/20/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Better than doing it yourself.  Better than paying for a cleaning person.,"We purchased our iRobot Roomba 650 about a 6 weeks ago.  My husband and I are transitioning to our second home, so our primary residence was looking a bit dusty due to my lack of time there.  I decided we either needed a cleaning company or a Roomba.  So far, it has been really helping us keep our place looking neat and tidy.  True, it doesn't clean stairs )-: or get into the corners, but if used as a twice weekly touch up after a great cleaning, it is amazing how good it works.  I didn't expect much and told my husband to use it as much as possible when he was there in case it was a bust and died after a few uses, but so far so good. I think the way to use this is to move things like cords away from the floor and it will be smooth sailing.  During Christmas, it kept knocking our candles off the windows until we raised them a little.  It just makes it easier than getting an error message.  I have not noticed any marks on furniture or woodwork, but I will look for that.  I think a flannel bumper should be included on the Roomba if people are having damage.  Wouldn't it be wise for the company to eliminate this problem.  Now hoping it has a long life.  I will try to remember to update in a few years if it is still working.  I have had many brands and other than my current vacuum, my experience is that they have a very short life.Pros:  I don't have to spend all my time at my temporary residence making up for being away so much.  I can do other things while it is vacuuming.  It can be programmed.  It is very small and you can even hide it under furniture if you want to.  It does a great job on wood, carpets and tile so far.Cons: Noisy, but no where near as noisy as my regular vacuum cleaner; not even close.  Doesn't do stairs or corners.  It can get stuck under things even though it got in there in the first place.  It must be cleaned after every use or I see a short life."
10/27/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Not just an indulgence...,"We owned a Roomba when they first came out, and it was a disappointment.  We spent more time cleaning the Roomba than the Roomba cleaned our floor.  This one is a treat.We set it to go at our hallway and laundry room floor tile. In about 20 minutes, the dustbin was completely full of dog hair and dust.  Roomba is superior to a broom in the amount of dust that it picks up.We were absolutely amazed each time we set it to vacuum up a different room in our house.  When Roomba is finished, the floors are definitely cleaner than when I use a traditional vacuum, or sweep the tile with a broom.The downside to this little guy is that we have women with long hair in our house, and the long hair gets wrapped around the parts.  About every fifth time, we end up having to use scissors to clean out the roller balls and the cleaning brushes.This is time well spent each time I see how much ""yuck"" is in the little dust bin.  This product is not an indulgence for people with allergies and/or pets, it's worth the investment."
12/28/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Woodhouse - Highly Recommended,"We named our Roomba 650 Woodhouse, after the butler in Archer (Spot was a close second in the voting).With a few reservations, buying a Roomba may have been one of the best purchases I have ever made, the house is much more free of dust, dirt, and hair than any other place I have lived before, and with little to no effort on my part.While Woodhouse does not get every last spec of dust and dirt in the whole house, he does an excellent job getting almost every one. Almost as important as the cleanliness is the entertainment of watching him work his way through the house, around (and sometimes trying to go through) furniture. I glued two googly eyes to his top, creating a smiling face with a bulbous nose which just adds to his drunken clown-like behavior.The best part is that, if we don't want him underfoot, we can schedule him to run as many times per week as we want, and we come home from work to a clean home (we joke about him cleaning the windows and counters, but he never gets there).My reservations:His erratic path does sometimes miss obvious dirt, which can either be spot cleaned or leftThe sensors are REALLY bad at seeing dark-colored furniture, a few of our pieces have small dents around the legs where he rammed into them full speed (versus slowing down, like with walls)He seems to clean certain rooms more and more completely than others, this may be due to the path he chooseHe gets stuck on thick rugs and our bathroom scale and can't always get offThe cord detect only works half the time, usually once a week we come home to find him choking on a phone charger (our fault for leaving it around, probably)Either way, I love Woodhouse so much that I bring him to my family's home (they have four dogs) where he does quick work of the dander and pet hair. This Roomba was a great purchase, and has saved me countless hours of vacuuming, more than paying for itself. We have no pets in our ~1000 sqft apartment (which he has no problem covering), but we bought this version for the better ratings and durability, and it seems to have been a good decision."
6/2/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great product,"We made the decision to rearrange our house slightly to maximize the ability of the Roomba to do its thing without getting stuck. Since then, its been a dream. Picks up a lot better than I expected, too."
5/23/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,Worked great and now won't hold charge more than a few minutes,"We loved this at the beginning. NOW 5.5 months later it is not holding its charge. It will run a few minutes and say it needs to be charged. I have kept it clean, re set it, charged it for extended time. I am calling Roomba and seeing if the 1 year warranty will hold true since we bought it here on Amazon. I just want it repaired. I miss Rosie. That is our name for our Roomba."
12/26/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,We love this thing. Will never sweep with a broom again
11/6/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Does a great job... maybe too great...,"We love this Roomba.  Our only complaint is due to our time constraints.  We have 3 dogs... so lots of dog hair.  We figured if we run this every night... then it could keep up.  But, due to the fact that it is very thorough... it takes us about 10 minutes to clean all the dog hair out of the rollers before we can use it again.  Consequently, we get ready to go to bed... then think about starting up the Roomba and inevitably... we both say ""I'll clean it tomorrow""... but tomorrow never comes.So... if you have animals... expect to have to clean it often.  Other than that... it does a great job!!"
5/19/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We love this vacuum!,We love this robot!  We call her Sweetie and we make her go to work every day. Set up an automatic schedule and your house always looks great
7/1/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Good little helper,"We love this little guy. We call him ""Lil Fella"".  I am a working mom and even right after I vacuum the floor start looking crappy again. My family is messy. I turn this guy on and he makes life easier.  Sometimes he gets stuck somewhere. Like just wiggles himself on top of something and he can't escape. If you're home you can hear him struggling and we just say ""you need help little fella?"" and move him a few inches over.  He doesn't always make it back  to my bedroom so I just put him in and  close the door and voila. He gets to every little but he can.  He is too tall to go under my dressers. We had a Neato for a second-  it would go under but in general it wasn't very good and then a week in it stopped charging. The Roomba also isn't very loud- WAAAY quieter than the Neato and quieter than my upright. He doesn't even scare the cat.Now I will say if you think this will completely replace your cleaning efforts, it won't. And if you expect him to never get  stuck and work when you're away and you never touch him, that's not realistic.  But for the price he makes my life a little easier and for that I thank him. Thanks Lil Fella!"
11/29/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Good little robot,"We love the scheduling ability of the Roomba - we set it to run every roughly every other night after we go to bed. It's about as loud as a hand-vac sitting on a remote-controlled car. When it's a floor below us, we can hear it, but it doesn't keep us awake. When it runs in the basement, we can't even hear it. It does miss spots on any given run, because it runs so frequently, it continues to keep the floor clean. It handles hard wood floors, rugs, and carpets equally well, and even does a good job getting under our couch. Occasionally we wake up to find that it's gotten tangled in something we didn't know was there, but it generally does a good job avoiding obstacles. It's easy to clean - everything you might want to remove or open is marked in yellow (except the big button to remove the trash bin), which makes it pretty easy to remember how to clean it."
8/18/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We love the Roomba 650,"We love the Roomba 650.  We have several dogs in the house and one has fairly long hair.  The Roomba does a great job of collecting the hair and dirt off of ceramic tile and sculpted carpet. We have found that for best results, clean the dirt trap and the roller brushes after each use and it's always ready to go the next time.  Cleaning the roller brushes is a little tedious, but they send a great little tool that helps you tackle this task in an efficient manner.  I wish I had ordered one sooner."

3/22/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We love our roomba,"We love our roomba. Just need to get better about leaving things on the floor now.We had a $600 Miele vacuum before it and now we hardly ever have to use it. Really just for the stairs.I've thought about getting one for the downstairs but really it's not that hard to bring it downstairs every week or so.I would like to keep my place super clean on a weekly basis. I don't have a ton of time with my work and I'm thinking about hiring a cleaner. It'd be awesome if there were just robots to do everything around the house, but the vacuum is a really sweet start."
10/31/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,You NEED this!!,We love our little Roomba. We nick named it R2D2. It's amazing how much pet hair and dirt gets sucked up by this thing. We have 2 cats and a dog so there is plenty of pet hair!  The cats were afraid of it at first but now they just steer clear of it when it is running. We give it 5 stars!!!!
12/27/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We love our IRobot,We love our IRobot.  We have just adopted a dog and the 650 picks up the dog fur with no problems.  We have it set for midnight while we are sleeping.  Nothing like having your own 3rd shift cleaning crew.

4/24/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We love Roomba!,We love it! I will say it sat in a box for almost 9 months unopened because I wasn't ready to give up control. But once my 5 year old begged me to see the Robot and promised to pick up her toys better I caved and there's no turning back! Cat wasn't freaked by it. It sucks up a ton of cat hair too and ours is a Maine Coon. I like to set it to clean when I'm ready as opposed to the scheduled method. So far so good!
1/3/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We love her. Yes,"We love her.  Yes, her.  My wife named her Rhonda after ""Help, help me Rhonda"".  She manages to work her way through and around out clutter to help keep the floors clean.  We really do think this is a great investment."
5/25/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This unit is perfect for our needs,"We live in the desert and track in lots of ""stuff"".  We have concrete floors.  This unit is perfect for our needs.  When we go out for an hour or more we simply unleash this robot and return to a clean floor.  It finds it's charger and returns home perfectly.  We love this unit."
6/29/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love this little guy!  Spread out rooms are not a problem.,"We live in a condo with multiple rooms spanning a pretty large distance. In total, it is two bathrooms, two bedrooms a long hall and a closet.  The distance from the Roomba home base to the farthest room is about 70 feet. All hardwood floors.  I was concerned that Roomba would not make it to the far end room without losing signal or running out of battery. My fears were unfounded.  The Roomba has been operating for two weeks with no problems. Every day it cleans every single room, then returns to it's home base with no problem at all. It has also not fallen down the stairs to the lower level.We also have two places where there is a raised transition strip to a different flooring material (tile in bathrooms).  I was concerned that Roomba would high center on these strips or see them as a wall and not continue into the bathrooms. This has not been a problem. Roomba just rolls right over and cleans those bathrooms like a champ.My wife, who typically does the vacuuming  (she is retired while I am not) thanks me daily. No more vacuuming!"
3/24/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I feel it is a tad overpriced but we are quite happy with it,"We just got tile flooring. I was sweeping 2-3x a day due to dogs. I haven't had to sweep once since getting the roomba. It is scheduled to go out once a day and every couple of days I will run it a 2nd time. The debris container is always full. The only complaint I have however is, it says it won't get caught up on wires or rugs etc but that is untrue. It does. A lot I might add. Even flat type rugs. I constant find it in *error* on the mat by the back door and that is actually very thin. I feel it is a tad overpriced but we are quite happy with it."
11/16/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Fights Fur Furiously,"We just got ouriRobot Roomba 650 Vacuum Cleaning Robot for Pets.  It was simple to setup and charged in about two hours.  We have run it once downstairs and upstairs.THE PLANThe plan is to run it during the day upstairs and to run it at night downstairs.  The first problem we noted is that the schedule only seems to allow one time per day.  This is ok since we have to carry it upstairs for the day runs.  So, we just start it as we live in the morning.  When we return, we put on the charger and let it clean at 2AM downstairs.OBSERVATIONSThe upstairs (approx. 1000 sqft) is a combination of wood floors, tile in the bathrooms, scatter rugs (bath style and oriental).  Roomba did a good job covering an awkward area.  We captured a full bin of hair from the dogs.  The only problem is that it got caught in the toilet area after it managed to close the door on itself.  It found out that it was too short to reach the handle to reopen the door.  Roomba was able to clean under the bed and sofa.  However, it was unable to get under the night stands and dressers.  This was unfortunate because the floor and fur is still very visible.  (We will have to consider replacing the furniture that we bought a month ago.  I can see it is going to be a pain to clean under whether we have Roomba or not).The downstairs (approx. 800 sqft) is all tile with scatter rugs (bath, entry and orientals).  Roomba was able to get under the counters in the kitchen, under the sofa, the dining room chairs.  Once again we captured a full bin of fur. Downstairs we had a few problems.  Roomba managed to catch itself on a rug.  Roomba announced that it needed help.  It was also able to move a very light side table and an empty plastic dog dish.  The bin was full of fur and even captured some large dog food nuggets.  Roomba was also able to maneuver through electrical cords.  We did absolutely no preparations before starting Roomba.LIMITATIONSRoomba does not do windows, stairs and areas that are shorter than itself.INITIAL CONCLUSIONSWe are pleased so far.  The machine does a good job collecting fur in open areas and low areas that are taller than Roomba.  We will have to consider how to handle the light furniture and lighter carpets.  We will also have to determine how to ensure that open doors stay open if we want it to roam unrestricted.If you are a micro manager, you will have problems with how Roomba gets the job done.  If you are results  driven manager, you will find that the Roomba does a good job.  It gets where it is designed to get, and it does a thorough job.  Roomba does its job.  Don't worry about how it does it.ONE WEEK CONCLUSIONS (11/23/2012)Roomba has been busy.  We run it about 8 hours per day.  We collect 4 full bins of fur every day!  Neither my wife  nor I imagined how much fur our dogs generated.  We just moved from a home that was primarily carpeted to hard surfaces.  It is not like they are big dogs.  We regularly strip our dogs (pull fur  with a comb).  We are more than both pleased by the purchase.  Even if we had a maid, we would still run Roomba regularly.  I don't think a daily maid service could keep up with Roomba's vacuuming or our dogs fur production.  It (or perhaps I should say we) does occasionally make a mistake.  It has eaten two usb cords and a couple of loose threads on some oriental carpets.THIRD MONTH CONCLUSIONS (2/15/2013)Roomba has not been needed as much.  I would guess he gets about three hours of work a day.  Once a day downstairs and twice a day upstairs.  My wife and I agree that it has been a good purchase.  Two unexpected consequences: our HVAC filters stay clean much longer and dusting need not happen as frequently. Roomba looks a little battle worn with superficial scrapes.  However, the battery is still going strong.  We spend almost no maintenance time.  Every time we move Roomba, we empty the bin.  We have had to do some major maintenance (more than five minutes) a couple of times.  Long hair seems to collect and requires a careful unwinding.  (We are all short haired except my daughter who visited at Christmas).  The filter requires a little cleaning for optimal efficiency.  Sometimes Roomba decides to complete the job under the bed or under a sofa.  So, I have to call her.  She is about as good as our deaf dog about coming when called.  If we confined her to a single room, she would be much easier to find.  She is infatuated with bathrooms.  She still forgets that she can not reach the handle to open the door after she closes it.  We try to remember to close the bathrooms before she begins her work.FOURTH MONTH Conclusions (3/6/2013)Roomba has taken a beating over these four months.  She has lots of scratches.  We have lost our edge second whisker.  I bought one of the replacement packs with filters, brushes, rollers.  The battery is still going strong.  Roomba is getting a little senile.  She'll drop her dust bin and keep going.  So, she is just sweeping around dust.  I think we need to do a thorough cleaning to make sure the latches catch properly.  We are still very happy, and our house stays much cleaner.NINTH MONTH Conclusions (7/31/2013)Should Roomba die after the end of the warranty period, we would buy one again.  I would be disappointed, but we could not live without it.  If anything it is more important than ever, one of our dogs has Cushings and loses fur by the handful."
8/8/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Absolutely life changing (and that is not hyperbole!),"We have used this probably 10 times in the last 3 days, and it's just really fun to watch because it is so intuitive! Now we do have a great pet vacuum, and we thought our floors were really clean after we vacuumed and mopped. Holy crap, we were SO wrong. This little monster has crazy suction power, it gets in ALLLLL the nooks and crannies that we can never reach, and it gets under all the things I didn't think it would fit under. Our floors and baseboards have NEVER been cleaner, and our cat and dog shed a LOT! It also easily transitions from carpets to linoleum to tile to laminate, and it adjusts its brushes and such accordingly. Honestly, our carpets have never even looked this clean.We don't need to worry about it damaging the legs of chairs or tables, etc., it detects it fast enough that it slows down and maneuvers around them like a pro. When it hits something, the tap is light enough and the Roomba material is ""soft"" enough that it doesn't hurt anything.We have cords and cables everywhere. Small ones, big ones, they are everywhere. This is the one thing I was pretty worried about. The detection on this thing is amazing. It will go over cords, all of them, but it detects them immediately and it will stop turning its brushes so it doesn't get it tangled, and it was roll on, sucking things up without rotating the brush. The other cool thing that I keep seeing is that when it does get wrapped up in a cord, it untangles itself by swinging around in the opposite direction. It's so cool. It won't pick up a sock, or a spoon or anything like that that might be accidentally left on the floor.Since these last few days have been the first time our floors have gotten a deep and thorough cleaning, we have had to empty the dustbin many, many times, but it takes literally 5 seconds. It could not be easier to pause Roomba and empty quickly, and then let it continue on. It picks up so much of my own hair that we need to clean the brush every cycle as well, but it's as easy as, or easier, than cleaning hair out of a hair brush. It's completely low maintenance and I am super lazy!I don't really understand how anyone can complain about the noise. I would say it's somewhere between a full-size vacuum and a box fan on high, although to me, it is closer to the sound of a box fan on high. I also get annoyed with noisy things and this little thing isn't annoying. It's more white noise than anything, unless it is repeatedly running into things and getting tangled up.I haven't tried the scheduling feature yet, but I plan to, as soon as the dog understands it is not a toy for her. I plan to update in a year or so. All the parts (no, seriously, ALL the parts) are replaceable. We could replace parts year after year and keep it alive for many years. When he finally dies though, I can promise we will immediately buy another. For someone with terrible, awful, no good, very bad allergies, this little birthday gift is life changing!"
8/24/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great help around this busy doggy household,"We have used this little guy several times a week for almost 2 years and it still tackles the massive amounts of pet fur with no problem!  It did get stuck under the fridge a couple times, but it knows to shut itself off. Periodically blowing out the filters with an air compressor greatly extends their life span and saves $."
1/6/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Best invention, ever.","We have two short haired dogs that shed like crazy. We have a light tile downstairs, and both dogs are white/cream so it's hard to see their hair, but you know it's there. I hated walking barefoot or in socks downstairs because I could either feel the hair/dirt on the floor or it would be stuck to my socks. I had a hard floor vacuum that I tried to use a couple times a week, but I didn't always have time.We got a Roomba for Christmas and I couldn't be happier!! We programmed it to automatically clean every night after we go to bed. It takes off, cleans the entire downstairs, and puts itself back on the base to charge when it is done. In the morning I just get up and empty it out (which takes about 10 seconds) and now I don't have to worry about cleaning the floor! Aside from mopping, but I would rather mop once a week then have to constantly vacuum the floor plus mop.We have used it in the day when we are home, but it is a bit loud. Not unbearably loud, but we just prefer it cleans when we are upstairs sleeping.Programming the unit is incredibly easy and cleaning it is as well. It also comes with a sensor that can be used to create a ""wall"" if you don't want it to clean in a certain area. We set it up by our dining room table because it goes under there and gets stuck like it's trapped in a pinball game. I highly recommend this product!"
9/27/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great for everyday use,"We have two rather large dogs and use this everyday. We move it around all three floors of our house and it works perfectly. Moves from hardwood to carpet with no issues. Does a great job, but obviously doesn't get everything that your normal vacuum wouldn't either. Maybe once a week we have to do a light sweep to get the rest, but it's great at getting into corners and picking up everything on it's own. It is fairly loud (like most vacuums), so don't plan on scheduling this to run overnight, as it's probably to loud to do so."
12/17/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,What did I do with you Roomba 650?,"We have two large dogs, a large cat and a toddler. We also have a backyard that has more dirt than grass.  Basically if we don't vacuum daily there is hair and dust everywhere. For a time I said I'd vacuum daily and keep up with it all, and I did.  The house was clean, we felt good.  But then I got tired of doing it.  Work got in the way.  Our daughter got older and more engergetic.  So I would avoid vacuuming for a few days, maybe a week, and hair would be EVERYWHERE.Enter the Roomba 650 (or Bobo the Robo as my daughter calls him), and the house is clean again!  I'm constantly amazed by the job this robot does.  I turn him on when I'm working from home or if I went to work that day, when I'm making dinner.  Bobo sets off on his merry way and gets all the dog hair.  He actually probably does a better job than I do, because he goes over the same spots multiple times.  I'm amazed at the stuff he finds even when the floor doesn't look dirty.Overall this thing has been a great quality of life enhancement.  I no longer worry about the hair.  No longer have to deal with my daughter getting covered in dog hair when she decides to roll on the floor.  Love this thing and wish I bought one earlier!"
11/30/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Dog hair is up!,We have two bully breeds that shed like crazy and track in dirt and plant matter. We've been running this thing once a day. I can walk around on my hard floors without putting flip flops on . . . Life changed.
11/30/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,... have three dogs in the house and this does amazing at keeping up with the hair,"We have three dogs in the house and this does amazing at keeping up with the hair. It is pretty loud, so I always schedule it to run while we are at work. Also, the brushes get pretty covered relatively fast. I clean them every other day or so. Regardless, I am very happy with the purchase."
11/18/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We like it!,"We have the iRobot for few days and it is working constantly. It's great to pick up everything from the floor and then just let it work until the battery is empty. It can work about an hour and it covers most areas in the room or floor. We used it in both floors and it's working great. It was also very easy to operate the first time, just remove the battery protection, first charge over night - and start working the next day. This innovation is really awesome!"
3/5/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great floor cleaning assistant.,"We have owned this vacuum for a about a week and I'm impressed. We love the scheduled cleaning (set for midnight every night).  I would not have this as my only vacuum, it is great as an in-between maintenance tool. It has only gotten stuck once.  If you use this as a helper it will you keep your place looking pristine."
4/10/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Wonderful!,"We have mostly hardwood floors with scatter rugs and this does an amazing job!  We have 2 dogs and 2 cats, no more tumble weeds of hair!  We used to heavy vac every weekend with spot cleanings in between.  Now we run the roomba every few days and have never felt cleaner.  Easy use, thorough and easy to maintain.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase!"
11/14/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Cheap and reliable,"We have just this robot vacuum cleaner for two months and compared it to the Roomba 880 and Miele Scout RX1 models (much more expensive models).Cons:- The brush design is so that if having pets as dogs or cats it gets filtered and needs constantly removal of hair. The 880 model is much, much better for pet hairs due to a very different main brush design (plastic tube)- Its noisy!- It uses long time for cleaning, often with problems locating the base station.- It may be programmed, but this is just repeating the same time each day. It is not possible to differentiate between days.Pros:- Relatively cheap- Does not have the charging problems or other major issues identified with the Miele and 880 model.- The Roomba room division/area system is working wellOverall, this model is suited for cleaning when out of home (noise/time) if not having pets. It seem reliable and works without major issues. Good value for money, but the location/pattern system and noise level is not up to the standard of the best robot vacuum cleaners."
4/24/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"well worth the money, can't wait for more robotic domestic help!","We have hardwood floors, some rugs, and a dog. Very open plan, 1 floor, 2000sqft. But this thing picks up all the dust bunnies before they form! Forces you to keep the floor tidy too!Great stuff. Love it. Makes the place look civilised again.First, have a good vacuuming. Then use this little 'bot little and often. Going to the store? Roomba! Having a nice shower?... the amount of stuff it picks up every day is amazing. No shit.Based on this, I'm looking forward to a lot more robotic domestic help.Downside? Well, it can get 'stuck' if your house is full of little spaces I guess, and you need to have all your crap off the floor, obviously. But the amount of pet hair it gets alone is worth the effort. And you need to remember to use it initially. Haven't tried auto timed cleaning yet, but if you made sure the place was ready, great."
8/21/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Can't imagine not having Roomba!,"We have had Roomba for about 1-1/2 years now, and I can't imagine not having it. While it doesn't vacuum along edges or in tight areas very well, it does a great job everywhere else. We have a cat, and when we shut off Roomba during vacation, we realize how much we need it once we return. It picks up pet hair really well. It works on both tile and carpet. The ball on the bottom broke a few weeks ago, but we were able to get a quick replacement from iRobot for about $6. A couple of the parts are a little difficult to clean because they don't come apart well enough to get all the hair out, but the rest is easy to clean. Overall, I would highly recommend this to everyone, especially pet owners who are sick of finding clumps of fur all over the floor even after they've just vacuumed the day before."
11/30/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Alfred gets the job done!,"We have had our Roomba for about a month now and I can't remember life without it.  We have a shetland sheepdog that sheds and the amount of hair in our house since ""Alfred"" started with us has been reduced drastically.  Every once in a while Alfred will get trapped somewhere but it hasn't been a big deal for us.  The only thing I really dislike is having to clean the brush. Our dog has longer hair so it gets tangled up easy..this had to be done with our old vacuum as well. We have it scheduled to run while we are gone during the day and we move it upstairs and back downstairs every few days. I try not to watch Alfred work because it can be quite annoying seeing him going for a speck on the floor only to have him turn away at the last minute.  He gets to it eventually though and all is well.  The virtually wall has worked well for us when we use it. My only complaint is that I didn't get one sooner!"
1/20/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,So awesome!,"We have had our Roomba for a month now and couldn't be happier. We have little kids, which leads to a lot of crumbs on the rug in the living room and under the dining room table. Well, not any more! Thanks Rooba! This little robot friend is programmed to come on at 10 every morning and clean up, and it does a great job. Also, being able to threaten the kids with, ""if you don't pick up your toys, the robot is going to eat them,"" works like a charm!"
6/5/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Pets make Roomba a necessity.,"We have four cats and mostly laminate floors, and Roomba has become absolutely indispensable in the 10 months we've had it. Our cats shed so much that I used to have to sweep the house daily, but now I just set Roomba to run every morning and empty it out every couple days. It works better on the laminate than on the carpet, but it still works great either way. It's surprising how much stuff this little dude picks up. However, I wish it would stop vacuuming up cat barf. It doesn't seem to spread it across the house like one reviewer said, but it does get the puke all over the undercarriage, which is unpleasant to clean. I'm happy to clean dried puke out of Roomba once a week rather than sweep daily. The only real problem we've had is that the motor (presumably) for the side brush has recently stopped working. Roomba is definitely less effective without this brush, as it is what allows the robot to clean corners and along walls. It's better than nothing, but I'll be contacting iRobot support to resolve the issue. My aunt has had the same issue with her Roomba (she has a fancier model), but her brush stopped working after just a few weeks."
12/4/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I persisted in search of a work around and glad to say I found it online,We have designer carpet with black stripes and squares ........ our Roomba 650 kept stopping. I persisted in search of a work around and glad to say I found it online. Cover the four sensors with gloss photo paper with the gloss facing the lights to reflect it back and make it think it's working. Just tape the photo paper in place. This disables the lights that detect stairs ..... we have no stairs so it can't tumble down. You can use your electronic barrier for this. Lots of things work as a barrier. A lot of people are ready to send their Roomba back but this is all you have to do. This is a fine machine but users have to take things into their own hands sometimes.
7/30/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Really Good Robot Cleaner,We have been using the Roomba 650 now since I bought it for my wife for Christmas and the little robot is still chugging away and cleaning our floors.  And with three cats in our house I can assure you it does do a good job getting up most of the cat hair. So far no complaints.
8/26/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great product.  Great value.,"We have been using the Roomba 650 for about a month now.  Rosie, as we call her, is programmed to run 5 days a week while we are at work.  Also run sometimes on the weekend.  The only reason she does not get 5 stars is that is does not get into corners, but still well worth the money.  We have a Great Pyrenees that sheds like crazy and so it keeps the hair picked up on a daily basis.  Our main living area is all on one floor, so she cleans the entire floor (living room, dining room, kitchen, bedroom and 2 bathrooms). She does have to be cleaned everyday.  The areas that need to be cleaned are bright yellow, so it is easy to flip her over and clean the wheels and brushes.  Definitely recommend the Roomba 650."
12/29/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,We have an open architecture. Roomba is having trouble ...,We have an open architecture. Roomba is having trouble learning it. Not all areas are getting covered and it is also getting stuck.
3/18/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Meets realistic expectations,"We have an 1800 SqFt house over 3 floors.  The Roomba is used on at least one floor each day.  It will NOT replace your vacuum but it will cut at least in half the amount of times you will need to run the big one (the canister on the big one is not as full as it used to be either).  Every week or so, I need to clean my wife's hair out of the brush along with the other strings and whatnot that get tangled around it. Other than that it seems to be doing a great job, it keeps up with the dog hair and the crumbs the baby drops on the floor.  Again, have realistic expections; this is not a Bissel or a Dyson but it will make their jobs a bit easier just the same."
3/31/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,My house always looks vacuumed now,"We have a bassett hound as an indoor dog and that means dog hair EVERYWHERE. We constantly battle to keep the carpet relatively clean on hair but what meant vacuuming every day. With the Roomba 650 we wake every morning to a freshly vacuumed family room. I recommend buying the recplacement filter/brush set. We have to clean the roller brushes every few days and also swap the filter every morning (cleaning the used on under running water). If we do not clean the filter, by the third day the unit is putting so much dust and dander in the air when it runs that it feels like I have buried my nose in a severe allergen and taken a deep breath.My main compaint has to be the once a day scheduling limit. After about a month I still find myself running the Roomba several times a day because I like the living area of the house to always look like showroom floors. I wish I could have it run ever 6 hours automatically."
4/30/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Couldn't live without it,"We have 4 dogs and a cat and used clean the floors every day and still couldn't get the hair issue under control. I would sweep and vacuum daily spending hours a week. We got the Roomba thinking it may be more of a novelty item, but after reading the reviews we had to try it out. Wow! It cleans under the couches, beds, and around the legs of the chairs and furniture better than I could with the hardwood floor vacuum. Before the Roomba purchase you would walk around in socks and always end up with pet hair stuck on them which would of course make there way into your shoes or on the couches. That does not happen anymore. The floors always look spotless like we don't even have pets. Another reviewer said that they still had to vacuum once a week. We haven't had to vacuum once since we got the Roomba. Now that we have had one I don't think we could ever be without it. It has truly saved us from a constant battle with pet hair!"
6/26/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it!,We have 3 small animals and hardwood/tile flooring so there were dust bunnies all over. Now our roomba runs while we're at work and we come home to a clean house! It's crazy how much hair dust and dirt it picks up on a daily basis. It moves easily over all our area rugs and door mats. Highly recommend it :)
8/29/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,good on hard floors,"We have 2000+ sq ft of tile and wood laminate. With four cats the Roomba 650 does a good job of managing the shedding. We run it one to two times each day and it is full of fur.It is not good when it comes to short-pile entrance rugs. It turns around when it encounters them or shuts down if it manages to get onto the rug. Again, this is short pile.If you have hard surface floors it should do well, but not on carpets."
7/1/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Disappointed in this little fella,We had the Neato vacuum a couple years ago and after the battery ran out we decided to give this one a try. In comparison this one is terrible! It makes the floors look like my 1 year old got ahold of the vacuum if it even gets that far! It goes in circles and gets stuck in corners (on nothing!!) the Neato would go in straight lines and make the carpet look so nice! I also dropped some bread crumbs on the tile to see if this vacuum could pick it up and it didn't so not sure if it even actually works on hard surfaces. Will definitely go back to the Neato when we repurchase.
2/4/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing,"We got the Roomba as a xmas gift but it was from Bed Bath and Beyond.  It was purchased there because I highly anticipated that it would need to be returned after one use.  Well I couldn't have been more wrong.  It picked up everything in it's path... we have lots of dog hair especially under things. It goes up and over my kitchen sink mat and my rugs/ hard wood floors. It did got stuck on our bathroom rug but unstuck itself but then it kept getting re-stuck so I moved it.  It is a typical thin bath floor mat.  How well the Roomba works really depends on the setup in your house but it's totally worth the money if it does. I read tons of reviews on Amazon before getting it. It amazes me how well it does at getting under furniture. My mom said my house never looked cleaner. The best part is it has a scheduler so you can set it to vacuum while your gone and come home to a clean house  I imagine we will still need to use the big vacuum once and awhile for areas the Roomba missed.Pros --Cleans house for you-Has a scheduler that you can set to turn on automatically at a certain time/days-Returns to its base when the compartment needs to be emptied or when battery runs low-Very powerful and intuitive at moving around the house and over/under rugs furniture and doorways-Easy to use and empty-Base can be stored under furniture to remain out of sight when not in use-Virtual wall works well if you want to contain Roomba to one roomCons-(These cons should not deter you, they are merely an observation of things that could be better.  I mean, it cleans your floors for you.  Enough said)-Takes a long time to cover every square inch of the room-Compartment fills quickly and needs to be emptied often (this also means it's working!)-Battery life could be longer-You have to clear your floors of anything that could interfere such as cords or long curtains, small toys etc.  (This is no different that running a real vacuum)Bottom line - If you don't like house work or have pets which require you to vacuum every day this is definitely worth a try!"
9/23/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Agador Spartacus for the win,"We got the Roomba and promptly named him Agador Spartacus (the houseboy from the Birdcage). He gets the ever-present dog fur off the hardwoods and nails carpet. He doesn't mind stepping up on things (there's a bit of a step to get into the bathroom. He handles it well) and he lets me know when he's eaten a sock or something. I have a patterned carpet and there is a black spot that he cannot clean. He just stops and gives me an error message. The rest of the house looks great though, so five stars for Agador so far. If you have all black carpet, don't get a Roomba. But otherwise, it's totally worth every penny."
1/14/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,WE gave it as a gift and they LOVE it.
7/2/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Awesome machine,"We do not have any carpets in our home, just tile and wood floor and a dog that sheds a lot. This thing does a great job cleaning the dog hair on a daily basis while we are at work. I am extremely impressed."
8/10/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I highly recommend this product for anyone with kids and/or dogs,We bought this Roomba for our dark hardwood floors. We have two dogs that shed a lot and we were having to broom sweep almost every day. Now we just set a timer for the Roomba every other day and it takes care of dog hair and dust. I highly recommend this product for anyone with kids and/or dogs.
2/9/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba is the best!,We bought this Roomba 650 to replace an earlier model.  The expense to fix the older model would have been prohibitive so we replaced it.  We always have 2 operational roombas in our home.  This new Roomba does an excellent job.  Roomba just keeps getting better.
1/1/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It's perfect for picking up cat hair,"We bought the Roomba for my elderly Mother. It's perfect for picking up cat hair! She runs it during the night a few times a week and she can enjoy clean floors, both carpet mad wood, and now I don't have to worry about her dragging out her big vacuum. Love it!"
1/18/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,... a Christmas present and so far it has been great. Punch a button and leave it and it ...,"We bought the Roomba for a Christmas present and so far it has been great. Punch a button and leave it and it vacuums the room or rooms with no effort by you. All you have to do is dump the dirt container and periodiacally clean the brushes when its through. Takes about 2 minutes. If it lasts for a couple of years, it'll be well worth the cost."
5/31/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing!,"We bought the Roomba after reading many reviews on this site, we have it scheduled to run when we are sleeping and we wake up every morning to a clean downstairs!It vacuums in a random pattern, so if you watch it, it will probably drive you crazy where it might miss a spot or get stuck, but it runs for an hour and a half on our downstairs and I never wake up to a spot that was missed."
12/12/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Goodbye Vacuum!,"We bought the Roomba 650 about 3 months ago and have it scheduled to run every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday when we are at work. It is mind-blowing that the apartment can be clean all the time with just some minimal work to empty and clean the Roomba! The space is a 2 BR apartment with a combination of hardwood flooring and carpet. The only issue we have is the Roomba occasionally shuts the bathroom door while it is inside and can't get out. Once a week I move the kitchen chairs against the wall to give it room to get into the corner.We had one problem where there was an ""Error 10: Spin Roomba's wheels"" and the right wheel had seized up. After contacting iRobot customer service they quickly shipped a replacement at no cost to us, along with instructions (which were very simple). We are very satisfied and it's a huge time saver. I hope to never vacuum again."
12/28/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,The Right System for People on the Go,We bought the iRobot 655 a week ago in an attempt to keep ahead of the shedding hair from our two Astralian Sheppards.  We run the unit for approximately forty five minutes every other day; And it's thorough as it runs indepentently without any need to rescue it - Amazing!! Although it has yet to indure the test of time we highly recommend this system for hard working people on the go.
12/1/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Awesome !,We bought a third.  Enough said :)
10/20/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,So much better than the gen 1 version,"We bought a pad with mostly hardwood floors and decided to try the Roomba again. I bought the first gen Roomba which lasted about a year before burning itself up. I went through 3 of them (we had 2 cats at the time) before calling it quits. It just wasn't ready for prime time. This iteration is definitely not like the last. I am quite happy with it especially for the price point. It gets stuck under the couch more often than not but we are working on this via the invisible wall.This version picks up all of the hair (1 dog, 1 cat and a long haired wife) and when not napping under the couch it parks itself in the charger. Nice."
2/18/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,An excellent supplement to an upright vacuum cleaner,"We are very pleased with our Roomba 650. It works well on all of our floor surfaces: wood, tile, and rugs. It is able to clean underneath a lot of our furniture. As long as the furniture has a few inches of height clearance for the Roomba to go underneath, it will be able to clean those difficult to access areas. The Roomba does a great job supplementing vacuuming with a full-size vacuum. It will keep your house reasonably clean for a decent amount of time in between manual cleaning sessions, but it probably will not completely do away with the need to manually clean from time to time. It will however do a better job than a half-hearted manual vacuuming session. The Roomba 650 can easily be programmed to initiate cleaning cycle on specific days of the week at specific times.  We set ours to clean three times a week. The Roomba is very easy to open and empty the collector bin, and we do so about once a week. The Roomba is gentle when it runs up against furniture or walls.  After using our Roomba for several months, it has successfully docked itself to recharge its battery after every cleaning cycle.  All in all, we are very satisfied with our purchase."
5/20/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,iRobot does the trick,"We are retired and live in a 40 ft. motor home full time with a dog that sheds like crazy.  I was spending much time trying to stay ahead of the dog hair on the tile and rugs.  The iRobot, nicknamed Raul', works out great for our situation.  We spend much time hiking as we travel the U.S.  So it's easy to just turn Raul' on and walk out the door.  The cliff sensors keep him from falling down the stairs, and the combination rotating brush / vacuum does a great job on the throw rugs and tile.  I will say the first few times he swept, it seemed as if he wasn't picking up all the dog hair, but I realized the rugs had much more hair on them than I thought.  After he ""got on top of the excessive dog hair,""  this was not a problem.  Knowing how much my dog sheds, I can't say I'm surprised how full the sweeper bin is each time, but that's because the iRobot is doing a great job on the rugs as well as tile.  It is important to clean the bin, filter etc each time the iRobot sweeps, but that takes far less time than sweeping for sure!"
1/18/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"So far, so great","We are doing construction in the house and Roomba has been a good partner in helping us keep the place half decently clean. It does not pick the very fine dust that settles after wall demolitions, so one still has to mop the floors, but you can count on it to pick up everything else, especially if you give it the time to do it's unique pattern of space coverage. We've had it now for 18 days (received it 12/31/14) and used it almost every day for as long as its battery lasts."
9/4/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,We love it and recommend buying one if you need it,"We are astonished at the ability of this little robut to clean around all of our furniture including our wood burning stove (during summer).  It learns the layout of the floor and sweeps up all the dust.  It leaves the wood floors shiny, the brick floor without crumbs, and the section rug smooth and clean.  It even cleans under the sofa and bed without getting all bunged up in wires.  What else could we ask for.  Don't answer that.  We love it and recommend buying one if you need it."
8/18/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Seems to do what we hoped it would do,"We are a couple with no pets, no children in our home, so we don't really have a lot of dirt.  We charged the Roomba as recommended overnight and used it the next day.  It ran for about an hour and then headed back to the dock.  It charged quickly and we used it again.  It did get stuck one time under the dishwasher, but in all other circumstances was able to free itself.  It does a good job and I was amazed at what it picked up.  I was a bit concerned that ""cleaning all of the yellow parts"" would make it less desireable, thinking that if I had to do that everytime I emptied the vacuum that it might not be worth it.  But, it was easy to do, so I'm not bothered by that anymore."
2/14/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Changed the way we keep our home clean - for the better.,"We absolutely love our Roomba! With two cats it can be a struggle to keep up with the fur they create on our hardwood floors. We find that it has some trouble with one of our rugs, but otherwise, it works as advertised. We clean out the compartment every 1-2 days, and it is full every time with hair, dust and dander. Once every couple weeks, we use the handy cleaning tool provided and flip it over and clean out the brush unit. It comes apart very easily and is a cinch to clean. I'd say it takes maybe 5 minutes to do this cleaning. If you don't do that more thorough cleaning the Roomba will start to get noisier - but keep it clean and there's no problems!"
1/31/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Way better then what I was expecting the best thing I ...,Way better then what I was expecting the best thing I have ever let live in my home!!! My african grey is not okay with it at this point but the cat loves it!!
12/30/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,"Wasn't sure how good it would work.....WOW, it's great!!!"
5/22/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Surprisingly effective,Was slightly skeptical but was pretty tired of sweeping up after our 4 cats during the summer. Got this one because of the scheduling capability. Bought 4 virtual walls and this thing is saving me a bunch of time every day. Does a mix of hardwood and carpet. Got it at BB&B because of a 20% coupon.Thoughtfully designed and easy to disassemble and maintain. Would like to get a second and perhaps a scuba.Does not replace vacuuming once a week but would definitely recommend.
12/5/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,It isn't a Kirby or a dyson but it does a pretty good job,Was a little worried at first from the other reviews I had read. But I made the jump anyway. It isn't a Kirby or a dyson but it does a pretty good job. It goes from tile to wood to carpet and does a good job. The only down side is if you have a lot of human hair you have to clean it more frequently.  But I'm very pleased overall.
12/21/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Extremely pleased,"Very thoroughly picks up dirt, hair, dust, and little pieces of cat litter.  Keeps my floors clean and grit-free so that I can walk around barefoot without getting stuff stuck to the bottom of my feet.  I haven't quite figured out how it determines what pattern in which it will cover a room; it seems to move around at random, but I just let it go for a while and it eventually covers all the available floor space.  I live in a one bedroom one bathroom apt around 600-ish square feet, with tile in all rooms, except the bedroom which is (fake) hardwood.Now we just need a Roomba that mops!"

7/10/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love my Roomba!,"Very pleased with my Roomba!  I set it to clean every day when we are at work.  It does get caught some times under certain low furniture that I have to find it and put it back on the charger, but other than that I absolutely love it!!!  It is able to clean under areas I would never be able to reach with a regular vacuum like under beds, coffee tables, ect.  I wish I would have bought one much sooner!!!"

4/7/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Very entertaining to live with - and seems to  clean a lot more thoroughly than I ever expected.,"Very entertaining to live with one of these. The first time we ran it, it was like having a drunk person loose in our house. We turned it on and went into the family room. For the next hour or so, we heard it bumping into furniture and walls and chairs (gently, of course), we would see it come into the room we were in heading off in seemingly random directions, spinning around in circles at times, shooting off in a totally crazy direction after encountering an object, taking totally senseless paths around the room, leaving our room after just a couple of minutes, returning to our room for a couple of minutes, then leaving again prematurely, then returning, etc.. It roamed randomly around the several rooms it could access for the hour, then returned to its little dock and turned itself off. That hour of entertainment was worth the entire purchase price! I recommend you get one, invite a lot of people over, pour everyone a glass of wine, then turn it on for the first time. Your guests will have a blast watching the thing. But honestly, it got smarter and smarter each time we ran it. And it actually cleans a lot more thoroughly than I ever expected. We ran it after we had cleaned the rooms ourselves, and it came back to its little dock filled to the brim with dirt. So clearly, it was getting dirt we completely missed. I don't know how it will hold up over time, but from our initial experience over the first month, it has exceeded my expectations."
4/8/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It manages the climb up onto the rug easily and has not scratched the floor at all,"Very effective cleaning on both my hardwood floors and my area rugs.  It manages the climb up onto the rug easily and has not scratched the floor at all.  The programming is pretty simple to set it to work while you are out.  If you are home I feel it is a little noisy, however to be fair, my husband disagrees!"
3/2/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,Very easy to use.  Make sure to clean after each use.
3/3/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,If you have a rug be wary!,Very disappointed.  We recently installed hard wood floors through out our house so I was very excited to add iRobot as a family member.We had read all the reviews and had completed numerous comparisons~ we thought this would be perfect.When we purchased 2 area rugs we kept in mind that the rugs would need to be low cut so that the iRobot could get over them. We purchased a VERY low carpet just so the iRobot could work.Apparently our rugs are not low enough or iRobot does not have enough power.  Since we have purchased the vacuum it has not completed 1 cycle of a complete clean.  Every morning when I come down he is caught on the rug. Very frustrating.I would return this in a heartbeat except I checked our return date and the window closed yesterday:( I guess I will purchase grippers to apply to the wheels and hopefully this will help propel iRobot over my low lying rug.Our friends just recently purchased a robot vacuum and have carpet through out the entire house.  They love theirs~ it runs perfectly and is never stuck.  AHHHH

So now i am left to purchase a ac adapter to plug it in...so the scheduled cleaning is not a breeze as i expected:("
12/17/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Next best thing to hiring a maid,"Vacuum Area LayoutSq. ft.: 600Flooring: CarpetFurniture: Sectional, end table, ottoman, valet chair dining room table, cat tree, desk, office chairCats: 2Dog: 1Pros: Cleans areas thoroughly with spot clean feature Cleans hard to reach spaces (like under the bed) that are awkward to clean with a standard vac Roomba requires very little maintenance Huge convenience and time saver. Can be programmed to run anytimeCon: Gets very confused under the dinner and end tables Hard to confine to a space without electronic fences If interrupted during cleaning cycle will re-clean areas, get lost and shut off before finishing an areaPurchased Roomba 650 at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $320 with 20% coupon after owning a previous model for 3 years with no complaints.  So far, the Roomba 650 does an even better job of cleaning-up after us, our cats and puppy than its predecessor. The Roomba is fairly easy to program (ours is programmed 2 days/week) and covers the entirety of the house fairly well. Any spots that don't get perfect coverage in one cycle will get it in the next one or two. It's always surprising how much ""stuff"" is in the storage bin at the end of a cycle. It can get in a lot of spots (like under the bed) that are awkward to clean with a standard vac. The ""spot"" clean feature is also very handy. If something spills or if a high traffic area (like the front door) gets messy, just plop Roomba down and it will concentrate on that one 3 foot diameter area for 30 seconds or so.To quote another review, like our previous Roomba its not the maid from the Jetsons so dont expect it to run without maintenance or occasional surveillance. First, although Roomba requires very little maintenance you have to clean it. Cleaning the bin out after every run, and clean its brushes, wheels, and filter infrequently helps its performance. Second, the Roomba trains you to pick up after yourself and keep things off your floor. For starters, leaving shoes, wires, and other items in its path will not necessarily harm the device--but you may find it stuck at times. Also, the Roomba can pick up almost anything is its part (at least for a while) including leaves, paperclips, hair barrettes, animal fur and long hair. While this might seems impressive at first it will likely get full and not pick up much else afterwards on until emptied.All in all, I would buy again without a second thought. It's a huge convenience and time saver. My floors stay much cleaner than when I was manually vacuuming, and now I hardly have to do anything at all. With the hectic pace of life vacuuming is now one less chore we have to worry about."
7/4/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Such a great helper! Highly recommended,"Vaccume the floor completely and independently : know how to find its batty and how to escape from falling the stairs,Such a great helper ! Highly recommended."
11/19/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Its a paperweight,"Used to be a 5 star review! I loved this cleaner..until it stopped working for no reason. It won't charge ..it's a paperweight. I followed all troubleshooting steps..purchased a new battery..cleaned connectors etc etc etc. I contacted iRobot Customer service and they advised that I purchased battery that wasn't authentic (purchased from amazon.had 5 star reviews and is $50 cheaper than iRobot version) I tested the original battery and the replacement battery..both have over 10 volts yet neither will power on the cleaner. So I just shelled out $80 for the ""authentic"" battery with the hopes that iRobot Customer service will continue to assist. I have had the cleaner for 6 months. Purchased in May 2015. It worked great when it worked...now it's just a sad reminder of $600 spent and I'm sweeping my floors :/. If iRobot Customer service can't fix this then I'll have to keep this at a 1 star review. For reference...my roomba ran twice a week for 6 months. I have replaced filters and brushes twice in that time."
12/23/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,It Failed!,"Used three to four times a month, purchase effected in January 2015. It squeals, squeaks and creaks during operation. So soon it has become a reject. And there is no way I can claim it. I'm afraid it stops or sticks next time when I switch it on."
11/15/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Useful,"Use this all the tome. It is somewhat of a pain to clean but it's worth it for casual cleaning. You still need a regular vacuum, but this is great for the between times. Excellent product, well made, and durable."

11/5/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba is a true and pure luxury that you DESERVE.,"UPDATE12/10/12:  WELL it just gets better and better... my house has never been so clean and with so little effort on my part... Since getting this roomba 2additional more friends ( total of 5 now)  have added a roomba to their homes. They tell me it is one of their best purchases.  THumbs UP for Roomba !______________________________________________________________________First let me say that having a Roomba is a true and pure luxury that you DESERVE.Well as a owner of a Roomba already and being quite pleased with it,  I was most anxious to try out the new 650 for pets.There are many tasks we are  charged with doing around the house that are , can I say boring and unpleasant, For me  vacuuming was one of them.. I dislike the loud sound  and the repetitive motion and that I never, ever seem to be DONE with that particular job..  As It seems I hardly finish and the lovely long haired cat seems to think that is the time to GROOM  and I am left with more hair where I just spent the last 1/2 hr cleaning... So when the Roomba arrived in my life ..All that changed.. It allows for  you to set a Schedule of regular clean up..  So you no longer have marathon sweeping sessions.. Roomba  does her job without directionBy the way a ROOMBA is a great entertainer for the CAT as well.. She is fascinated watching her move around the  house and keeps her totally entertained EACH time..She never gets tired of it.  I have a WHITE kitchen tile as well as bathroom tiles.. and any little crumb or drip of cereal SHOWS up like a Beacon. and I am not the tidiest cook in the world. But Roomba cleans up AFTER ME.. what a nice thing . I now come home to a CLEAN  nearly hair free and crumbfree floors... That I need do nothing to get that all done/ it is pure joy to KNOW that the mess isn't waiting for you.. My only JOB is to clean out the  small dustbin on the side of her and I do that every 2-3 days depending.. Takes less than 10 seconds.  And that is it.. and occasionally clean the brushes.  She cleans all the areas I NEVER get to .. like really close to the baseboards or UNDER the couch or beds... now my house is much cleaner than it ever was when only I was responsible for this cleaning chore..  then sweet Roomba entered my life.( sigh)  Let me say the ease of set up and instruction is wonderful...Take it out the box ( partially charged ) and turn on the button and away she goes... To get the max out of it is best to fully charge her before putting her through her paces. She comes with  some extras like the Virtual Wall ( helps control the flow of the cleaning for you) extra  filter and a charging base..I am going to get a 2nd litehouse for her.. As that allows me to better control the flow of her cleaningWhen I am home and she switches on,  a little TUNE is played to let you know she is OFF to do you daily chores... SWEET  SWEET SOUND.....After seeing my Roomba not one but two of my pet loving friends were OFF to purchase one ASAP.. And after they got them, their feelings were the same.. One told me she LOVES that all the little bits of litter her cats seems to attract is now gone from all her hardwood floors The other has a 2story house and dragging her old EXPENSIVE ball cleaner up and down to vacuum was getting old.. NOW she take Roomba up in the evening.. Turns her on and lets her go.. Later that night she brings her down stairs and puts her into her charging base and before she gets up in the morning Roomba CLEANS up the downstairs for her.. Now that is PURE LUXURY  and Pleasure to get  clean floors with so little effort.I can heartily recommend this Roomba if you want to make your life simpler and  happier.. ESP. If you share you home with one or more  4 legged friends..  This will put a smile on you face every time you hear Roomba sing her SONG>>"
11/5/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Huge improvement over previous roombas,"Update - two years later and my roomba 650 is still going strong - none of the problematic cleaning head modules or broken/clogged gears that my roomba 535 had.  I replaced it's Nimh battery with a li-ion battery sold here on amazon and it now can vacuum my entire downstairs on one charge - and that battery has been going on strong for over a year now with no issues - so I highly recommend replacing the battery with a li-ion one.I had a roomba 535 prior to this, and really got tired of pulling all the pet hair out (I have 3 dogs and a cat) - this new model is a huge improvement over that - I don't know how they did it, but they managed to pet hair proof it and somehow dog hair doesn't get stuck in the brush roll like it used to - it makes maintenance so much simpler with this one.  I also like how this one can go room to room and clean thoroughly without needing the lighthouse that older models needed.  And the onboard scheduling is a huge benefit on this, I have mine scheduled to run automatically downstairs in the middle of the night while we are sleeping upstairs, so every morning I wake up to a nice clean living room/kitchen.  The aerovac bin on this is nice, but I had already upgraded to that on my old 500 series roomba - so the single biggest improvement on this model really is the cleaning head module - it's just way more pet hair proof (and hopefully sealed better).I hope this is more durable than older models too but only time will tell. On my 500 series roomba I would have to replace the cleaning head modules, and edge brush assembly about every 6 mos. due to the plastic gears inside wearing out after accumulating too much pet hair inside the assembly - I haven't taken this one apart to find out if it still uses the same plastic gears or not - hopefully I won't ever have to.The only reason I won't give it 5 stars, even tho I love roombas and can't live without them and will probably always have one, is that they require a lot of repairs over time (new battery - $69, new side brush assembly - $30, new wheel - $30, new cleaning head module - $40, etc.)- with the first part to go being the battery - which is a definite downside on this newer models - they have decreased the battery warranty to 6mos and the old ones used to have a 1yr warranty on the battery. of course it was probably costing them a fortune replacing batteries, because generally I haven't had a single battery last more than 8 or 9 mos before diminishing run time significantly. And the batteries are expensive, I really wish they would make them with li-ion batteries that last longer and don't degrade over time.  Also, for the price these cost, the parts really should last longer - by the end of 2 years on my 500 series I had replaced almost every single part, some parts I replaced multiple times - plastic gears stripping out, wheels no longer spinning, etc. until eventually it seemed like the main sensor went out and it just flat out couldn't find it's way around anywhere.  The good side, is that they do sell the parts and everything is relatively simple to replace yourself so you don't have to pay for expensive repairs unless you want to.I hope these things are improved in this model, because $400 or more is a lot of money to pay for something that only lasts a few years. Even with the headaches of maintenance and the short life span, I would still buy them tho, because I hate to vacuum and I have a lot of pets, and they work wonderful for the first few years (again, I am hoping that this pet model will be better able to hold up to heavy use over time).  Also, for the reviewer that said his wasn't docking itself, mine couldn't find the dock for the first few days, but once it mapped everything out it now finds it's dock perfectly every single time, so maybe he just needed to give it time to learn the layout of the land.I forgot to say - this roomba does an excellent job cleaning 3 rooms every night with no input from me.  All rooms are thoroughly cleaned and I am amazed at how much dirt and pet hair is in the bin every morning when I go to empty it.  It's the next best thing to having non-shedding pets!"
8/14/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"The beauty of it is, you can actually do other things while it works for you...","Unless you can't stop watching it! Day 1 and it's basically the best thing ever.  I do wish the side brush was a bit longer to get into corners, but you can't be too picky, right?  At first, I was disappointed by its performance, it didn't seem to pick up EVERYTHING, and it goes in this random ""pattern"" but eventually it goes over the same areas multiple times picking up almost everything (including Play-doh!). It doesn't completely replace my Dyson (I still need the handle attachments for baseboards, corners and windows) but it works just the same as a once over except I don't have to do it!I ran it for the first time last night without doing any pre-sweeping or vacuuming and that's a lot of dust, fur and play-doh when you have a 13 lb. chihuaha, 90 lb boxer and messy toddler (who proudly announced that ""we should call it Greeeen Button!"" but later refers to it as ""the black thing"").8/25/15 Almost 2 weeks with Green Button and still loooooving it!  So much so that we will probably purchase a more expensive one with hepa filter for the in-laws for Christmas!"
11/11/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Not cheap both well worth it!,Two Labradors is double the hair! We recently replaced our carpet with hardwood floors and you could really see the dog hairs  everywhere. I guess with the carpet the hairs were not as noticeable. I usually turn the Roomba vacuum on as I am leaving the house and then the timer runs it again at noon. The little dirt catcher is full everyday. I love it! Before I got it I was sweeping and vacuuming everyday when I come home. The other day I vacuum with my Dyson to see what the vacuum wasn't catching and there was very little hairs and dirt when I emptied it.
6/26/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Mankind will never be the same again.,"Truly man has met his match both in intellect and skills. Has man become the second greatest being on Earth? Did god create man, only for man to create its superior? The turing test may have passed, but are we prepared for the consequences of what life is like among those who could easily destroy us? The roomba challenges all we know about robots."
3/22/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,One of the best purchases we've made,"True story:  For our anniversary last year, my husband asked what I wanted.  ""A small, handheld vacuum we can use to clean up under the kids' breakfast table,"" I replied.  (Not very romantic, but appliances win out over roses any day in this household.)  We got this instead, and I'm glad we did.Why do I love it?  Easy answer - with three kids under six and a 90-lb Doberman, our floors (carpet plus hardwood) take a beating.  Both parents work full time, and when we're home we'd rather spend time with the kids than vacuuming.  This allows us to do that.  This model does a fantastic job picking up the dirt and dog hair.  I've heard mixed reviews on earlier models, but this one works great in our house.Anything else?  YES.  My entire house gets vacuumed more frequently now that I'm not lugging around the vacuum.  Did I mention that it cleans under your furniture?  And that I can run it in my kids' rooms after they've fallen asleep?  (It's not loud, but not silent either. I wouldn't recommend running it while your kids are trying to fall asleep, because it probably would keep them awake.  But if they're pretty good sleepers, you can probably get away with running it at night.)Is it durable?  So far, yes.  We've had it 6 months and run it 2-3 times per day to get all of the different sections of the house.  I will note that the side brushes don't hold up as well - we've gone through 2 already.  I'm not sure that everyone will have the problem:  our iRobot cleans between some iron railings on our top floor, which can't be great for the side brushes.  But luckily, the replacement part is cheap.What should you know?  I absolutely love my iRobot, but will be the first to admit that it isn't perfect.  First, the charging station needs to be plugged in 24/7, so there is the electricity cost associated with that.  Next, the iRobot doesn't do as well as advertised with wires - it occasionally unplugs things.  The iRobot sometimes gets stuck, especially if you don't do a complete walkthrough to identify and pick up things that could get tangled in the brushes.  And finally, you need to clean the iRobot after every time you run the vacuum - empty the bin and clean the brushes.  More infrequently you'll need to clean front wheel, under the side brush, and filter.  The cleaning takes just a few minutes, but I recognize that some people would prefer a vacuum that you can just put away in the closet after you're done.  If you're one of those people, this probably isn't the vacuum for you.What can't I comment on?  I don't use the electronic room divider.Final thoughts:  I love this guy, so much so that my 3-year old started crying when I told her that the iRobot, ""Scoober,""  was my ""best kid.""  (I was mostly joking. :) )"
5/8/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Complete waste of money,"Tried to program this thing while I was at work due to it being fairly loud and intrusive while I'm home.  It constantly gets stuck somewhere.  Underneath the couch or it gets caught on the ledge going into the utility room.  Since the pattern it takes is seemingly random, I have no idea what areas it covered and what areas it didn't cover.  Complete waste of money.  I had high expectations based on reviews but it's just not working out for me.  Would not recommend."
1/6/16,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Spend your money on something else.,"Totally dissatisfied. Sent it back. Not worth $365 Never worked without a problem. Thought it would be a time saver but with having to take it apart and reset it and calling customer service, no time was saved. Doesn't replace Getting out the vacuum or broom."
5/2/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,BEST!!!!,"Top ten purchases EVER made!!! Have 2 dogs, a single story house, neck injury and can't vacuum..ROOMBA to the rescue. I love this thing! My hardwood floors have never been cleaner. It really sucks up more grit and hair than my regular vacuum. PLUS I love that I can go do something leave the room and come back and it has not only cleaned it but gone back to its home to recharge.The design is brilliant. Cleaning/emptying it is easy and helped me see how much thought went into the design. Would totally recommend."

9/3/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba language,"Time for some Roomba reviews.""Roomba, ba-boomba!"" This means, ""Roomba, start and begin cleaning.""""Roomba, ka-toomba!"" This means, ""Oh, no! The Roomba is NOT in its base. It must be hung up on something.""""Roomba, sa-soomba!"" ""Found it. It's here in the (bedroom/kitchen/family room) hung up on (a piece of fabric/lamp cord/stuck under the counter).""""Roomba, ta-toomba!"" This means, ""Roomba is back in its base and charging to do it all over again tomorrow!"""
1/5/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Shh...don't tell the MIL your secret!,"Thrilled with the Roomba.  With 4 small kids, a dog, and both of us working full time and kids having sports, vacuuming is the last thing I have on my mind.  And it still is!  But the house looks so clean thanks to this little robot.  I am impressed with the results so far, we are one week into our Roomba's life with us.  It really picks up a lot of dirt and human/pet hair that we missed with our regular vacuum.  Cleaning out the dustbin and brushes is so easy.  While I don't expect this machine to be perfect... I am so happy to have it and even my skeptical hubby has been converted as well.  As long as it lasts (seems 5-6 years is life expectancy) for a long time I will be more than thrilled!Now when is the laundry folding robot coming out?  We will be first in line!!  Haha..."

Or clothes!4-But he met his match in my sons room.Overall hes a keeper !  Now I need someone to invent an Airhog Duster*Previous three bit the dust way too easily and quickly. Not sure what prompted me to try again, but glad I did!"

6/29/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Works Very Well!,This works very well.  I do empty it every other day and clean the brushes.  I am very happy with this iRobot!

3/22/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Thanks,This was the top of the line for us. Works like a charm. Picks up cat hairs and it is easy to clean.
1/16/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love It!,"This was the best ""Christmas"" gift ever!  It cleans great.  You just have to make sure that there are no items lying around on the floor if you want it to do a good job.  All I do is empty it every evening and it does all the work!"
2/7/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Best for open spaces,"This was really not appropriate for our home.  There is a lot of work involved in saving work.  After removing all the furniture and things on the floor, and worrying about the pets, so unable to leave it unattended, we sent it back.Best for open spaces, no kids or pets, minimalist furnishings."
4/22/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Rosie,"This was a splurge for me, but totally worth it. We love our 650, Rosie! I let it run every day. If I wasn't a dust-a-fobe before, I am now; this thing picks up everything so you can really see what settles on the daily. Its also really good motivation to keep clutter off the floor; I tell my kids to pick up or Rosie's going to eat their toys!We have 2 tiny humans and two cats, this thing is a life saver!! Only cons I've encountered are, it's too loud for the husband, but he's a poop, so don't mind him. And 2, it isn't as smart as I would like with accidental socks left on the floor or cords. Love that it can get under my cabinets; the dirt detect is awesome, and I've used spot clean, very cool design and programming!"
4/9/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great gift,This was a gift for my son who has a dog.  He told me it works amazingly well.  It is easy to program to vacuum everyday. Just about the best gift I have ever given him.
2/15/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Great, but NOISY!","This vacuum works well. It gets dirt far better than I thought it would!  It docks easily along a 2.5 foot space of bare wall (less than recommended) and cleaning it is even easier.  My only complaint is that it is noisy, so I don't like to run it everyday. The included virtual wall works great in front of our sliding glass doors.  Otherwise, the vacuum gets stuck in the door track. Works great on pet hair too (tho we have a doberman and he doesn't shed to terribly)."
9/9/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Had a very short useful life.,"This vacuum worked fine for a little over a year.  One day it was just dead - it would not turn on or charge.  It was used about 30-40 times and maintained very well.  At times it seemed like it took longer to keep the unit clean than it would take to vacuum with a regular vacuum cleaner but that is just the nature of the thing.After the unit stopped working and after trying all suggestions found on the internet, I contacted the company to see if they would stand behind their product.  They walked me through some troubleshooting steps (things that I had already tried) and concluded that I would have to replace the unit - at my cost.  There is no way I would waste another $300 + on another Roomba.  I am going to throw the thing away."
5/19/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,IRobot Roomba 650,"This vacuum was a house warming gift to my daughter, and she loves it.  She set the cleaning for a time that no one would be home, and when she get home, her floor and carpets are vacuumed perfectly!"

12/9/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Make the robots do the work!,This unit was shipped quickly as promised and is a replacement for on older unit that lost its sensors one to many times. They work great and are fun to watch but I think they should last longer than they do.
1/10/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,WOW SO MUCH CLEANER,This unit definitely exceeded my expectations. I got it for my wife for Christmas and she is a neat freak. She loves it. We both had no idea how dirty our floors and carpet were...this is an amazing cleaning device...so useful and easy to operate!!
2/8/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Just plain works.,"This thing's fantastic, one of the best purchases I've ever made for our home."
2/4/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,One of the best purchases ever,"This thing rules. It vacuums our house 4 days a week when we're not home. It's thorough. We have 2 puggles and 2 cats. The place is hard wood floors except for the kitchen and bathroom which are tile. We have a Flor area rug and a few throw rugs down. Our place is 2 bed, 1 bath, big living/dining area, and a kitchen. About 1100 sq ft. This gets everything. It takes a while which is why we love setting it for when we're not there. There have been 2 occasions where it got caught on a cord or something and didn't make it home to its base. But that's our fault for not prepping properly. Keep long, spindly stuff off the floor and this thing will do a great job. I hear the 700 series is the same price I paid for this one now. You should get it. You don't need the brand new version. The price to performance ratio isn't worth it. In my opinion."
10/16/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Holy Robot Vacuum, Batman!","This thing RULES!!!  I've been looking at these things off and on for about 5 years but couldn't convince myself it was worth the money.  We live way out in the country with 3 cats who are supposed to stay outside and prevent rodents, snakes and aliens from coming to visit, but the cats just walk away when I try to explain that to them. Oh sure, they'll bring me a mole or a gopher or a batch of baby bunnies to demonstrate their worth whenever they think I'm fed up, but mostly they con the kids into letting them inside and then sleep all day.  Never yet have they shown up at the door dragging an Ood or a Dalek along. Thank goodness for that, now I think about it. Anyway, the point of this rambling is that the cats think it's hilarious to manufacture vast quantities of fur and shed all of it while indoors. They also roll in cut grass, bushes full of prickers and the occasional dirt pile before darting inside and shaking it off. The floor seems impossible to keep clean for longer than 30 minutes.  So I did it. I shelled out $359 for this Roomba 650 and hoped it would grant me a few days between vacuuming without feeling like a horrid single father because my house was layered in stuff the cats literally dragged in.The Roomba arrived at 7pm yesterday. By 7:02 my teenage son had ignored the written directions entirely and set it up on its charging base with all the proper lights illuminated.  He pushed the 'clean' button and off it went, sucking up everything in its path!  Including an iPhone cord, my daughter's sock that for some reason wasn't on her foot, and a really disturbing amount of dust & fur. I mean, I'm not a slob and I clean regularly, for crying out loud!  Yeah, well, this stupid Roomba does a magnificent job. It cleaned along the baseboards beautifully. It spent a good 15 minutes purring around the beautiful motorcycles parked in my living room (told you I was single) and even went under the furniture. I'd worried it wouldn't suck hard enough to clean well or that the little dirt tray would fill up too fast - no such problems. It couldn't suck up the dimes it found under my night stand but it did fling them out into the light!It did a FANTASTIC job!!!The bad:Battery life is about 45 minutes. That's enough for my new robotic slave to clean the living room, kitchen, and make a foray into the laundry room. After that, he's off to his charging station for more juice.  That means the bedrooms and dining room don't get cleaned, so I'm ordering a second one to handle those.The software only allows you to program an automatic cleaning once per day.  It'd be nice if it would go back to work after taking a break, instead of acting like Congress and assuming that 90 minutes of work per day is enough.The dirt collection box is pretty small. We have 2900 sq ft of tile and wood floors and it'll fill its box in a single cleaning. That's just how it goes, though. The box is easy to dump and reinstall.The good:Sucks hard, picks up everything, and it even does a great job on baseboards!  It can't get into corners really, but must have good suction cuz it seems to clean the corners pretty well anyway.Despite the seemingly random pattern it covers the whole floor very effectively.I don't have to vacuum!!I love it. I'm getting another one to handle the bedrooms while this guy sticks with cleaning the common areas.Update 6 April, 15I did buy that second unit and am still completely happy.  I don't even have to bother vacuuming at all. Period.  I did learn that they will vacuum up cat diarrhea, unfortunately, but will then track that mess all over the house.  It took 6 hours - no joke - to disinfect the whole floor.  I was not having a good day that day.  Then disassembled the bots and suppressed the gag reflex to clean all the horrid stank from inside them.  I don't recommend this activity to anyone. Maybe to the ex, actually. But no one else.What I've learned in a year:  clean the buckets daily or at least every other day.  Brush off the filters or blow the dust out with compressed air (outside!) if you have access to such.  If you have a bigger house, the extended life battery packs more than double the cleaning time. I still get 45 - 60 minutes from the original battery but get 2 - 3 hours cleaning time from the higher capacity battery I bought."

We have a dog who sheds a lot. This roomba gets all of her dog hair and anything else thats on the floor. It is a little loud - but I turn it on when we're going out. By the time we get home, spotless floors. Its a little pricey, but worth every penny."
6/8/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,this thing is DOPE,This thing is totally awesome.... i was skeptical at first but it picks up a lot and i dont do anything at all. As a bonus it keeps my dog entertained which also serves as priceless entertainment. Highly recommend for anyone that isnt a hoarder.

11/14/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Technology at it's best,This thing is just what I needed.  I have used many variations of this product in the past but this one is just perfect.  Item arrived sooner than expected and was packaged accordingly.  This product was exactly what I wanted and when I need an upgrade  I will certainly order from this vendor
3/31/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Could not be happier!,"This thing is just silly awesome.  The wife and I haven't vacuumed our dark wook floors since we got this as a gift almost 4 months ago.  We are clean freaks, and hate to see crumbs and scud on our dark, hand scraped laminate flooring.  Our ""great room"" is almost 1000 sq feet, and this Roomba does a great job in about 65 minutes of running.  We program it to run while we are at work, and come home to clean floors every night!  Who wouldn't like that!Before we were vacuuming every other day because the dark flooring shows so many crumbs and dirt.  We also pick it up and carry it to other rooms in our house where we have the same wood flooring to do its work while we do other things.  It is a sweet little piece of technology!The people who complain about the noise either need jobs to go to, or should put up with a tiny bit of inconvenience while it cleans your house for you... It is in no way more loud than either our upright vacuum, or hard-wood canister vacuum.  It cant do what it needs to do without making a little noise people, c'mon!If you have hard surfaces that show quite a bit of debris, I would 100% whole heartedly endorse this machine.  It is fantastic an one of the best gifts we have ever received!"
12/5/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,A great product for the handicapped!,"This thing is great. I ordered it as a present for my handicapped mother who has a hard time even dressing herself. I schedule it to clean on its own three times a week, and all she has to do is empty the bin!Does it take longer than a human would? Yes. Does it bump into everything while going 1/4 mph? Yes.It does a better job on hardwood than I do with a broom. It also does a decent job of picking up between cracks and at baseboards. Short and medium depth carpets are a cinch.Pros:+ Easy to use+ Schedule it to clean when you're away! (It's not that loud.)+ Finds its way back to the dock+ While it bumps into everything, it travels so slowly and has a good bumper that it does no damage+ Great vaccum+ Gets cracks and baseboardsCons: - Expensive - Bumps into everything and can push light boxes/shoes - Floor must already be free of ""large"" debris"

1/14/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Rosie the Roomba,"This thing is awesome.  I set it before work a couple times a week.  It gets stuck behind our couch, so we just block off the place where it gets stuck.  Cat doesn't mind it."
10/18/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba Rocks!,"This thing is AWESOME!  It is scheduled to clean every day while we are away during the week, and it keeps our hardwood floors clear of cat hair.  Just remember to periodically vacuum the furniture and clean out the Roomba, and you will have an overall cleaner house.  We got this model because it seemed to handle obstacles better, and we aren't disappointed.  I was fearful at first that it would fall down our wooden steps, but the sensors immediately know if it is about to go over the edge, and it has ninja-like reflexes that stop it and pivot it away from danger.  It also comes with an invisible wall that I use to confine the Roomba to only certain parts of the floor.  This is very practical and does work.  The invisible wall requires 2 C batteries though to operate.  The coolest thing about the Roomba is that it automatically goes back to its docking station when it finishes to recharge, which only takes an hour or so."
1/2/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Close to perfect,"This thing is amazing. The basic fact is that it cleans my 800 sq ft apartment by itself. I don't have to vacuum anymore. I hate vacuuming. The vacuum is always too short of my superior physical stature and causes back pain. It picks up everything, I'm so impressed with how well the device works. Now, to be fair, the unit has gotten stuck every time I have had it clean, but I feel like its not really its fault. It will get stuck on small objects or wires that you leave on the floor. Make sure everything under your bed and couch is clear, or, isn't small enough for the Roomba to get stuck going over.Its adorable, we want to name it. How ridiculous is that? One time he got stuck in the bathroom because he shut the door while he was cleaning in there and I actually felt bad for him. As long as you baby sit this unit, or, you don't have a somewhat cluttered NY apartment, this thing runs great.I can't seem to figure out its logic, as it sort of seems random, and it does spend time running over the same places over and over until its done, and it can even appear seriously confused. Its also very loud, so I wouldn't recommend running it if you want to watch television or something.Some tips:Clean out the filter every time you run it (easy as tapping on open garbage can a couple of times)Clean out the brushes every three timesBest babysit it a few times to make sure its not getting stuck on thingsMake sure the base unit doesn't slide on the floor as the robot tries to dock with it"
5/17/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Picked up enough pug hair for me to build ANOTHER PUG!,"This thing is amazing. I watched it do the first cleaning and it's so smart and thorough. It went over dirty corners at least 4-5x and picked up an insane amount of dirt and dog hair. The best part was I had just swept the floor - clearly not as good as a robot can do. We'll see how the long-term maintanence goes, but for now, I'm in love."
5/11/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Just buy it.,"This thing is amazing. Aside from emptying the back collection tray and occasionally cleaning the brushed underneath of long hair (especially women's hair longer than 12""), there is no maintenance.  I have a dog that sheds (especially in the springtime) and i always had dog hair everywhere in my house - that is no longer a problem at all. Pretty amazing product for the cost. It is only $7.70 per week to keep your floor virtually spotless. Great deal."
8/3/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This thing is amazing. We have hardwood floors throughout the house,"This thing is amazing.  We have hardwood floors throughout the house, and my wife and daughter would spend hours each weekend sweeping and keeping dust-bunnies at bay.  I bought this Roomba on a lark, thinking I would try it, but not expecting much.  We all walk barefoot in the house now -- the floors are dirt and dust free.  I programmed it to run once-a-day, in the middle of the day when we're not home.  What's equally amazing is how much dust it picks up each and every day.  Worth every penny!"

9/20/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Surprisingly effective,"This thing is amazing.  Our family has three teens, a dog, a few cats, and now clean floors.  Our floor never looked this clean when we manually vacuumed.I expected this thing to get stuck occasionally, under a chair or tangled in one of the kids things always laying round, but it doesn't.  It's downright eerie to see it figure its way around a complex room.  It seems to have an insect-like intelligence.It's a bit noisy so you'll know when it's running, but it's not as noisy as a regular vacuum.  And it picks up an obscene amount of dirt and hair, from both carpet and bare floors.  Our pets were mildly concerned at first, but now they just amble out of its way when it comes towards them.Now I wish I had bought one years ago."
4/18/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Replaced Wife - this thing rocks!,This thing is amazing.  Cleans for 1 hour on my schedule.  Makes it's way around my dining room table and chairs like a pro.  Collects two handfuls of dirt/dust every three days.  Easy to clean and maintain.  Well worth the money.
1/2/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This thing is amazing!!,"This thing is amazing!!!!  Would buy another one in a minute!  We have 2 Cocker Spaniels inside, and we usually run it 1 time a day or every other day.  It blows my mind what it picks up simply because the floors look clean before we start it.  When its done however its almost always full."
12/13/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Awesome,"This thing is amazing!  I can sit in my recliner reading my kindle while it scurries around cleaning my house.  With 5 dogs, it's amazing how much dirt is in the bin every day. It seems to learn as it goes.  The first few days, it would clean for an hour, then dock and charge it's battery for a couple hours and then go back at it for another hour.  Now it only does the first hour.  The floor is spotless!"
6/1/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it!,"This thing is amazing!  Every day I empty the tray and there is more dirt even though I didn't even know I needed to vacuum.  So easy, too!"
12/19/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,No more dust bunnies under the bed.,"This thing is a real trooper.  It manages to find its way under and behind furniture that I would never expect it to navigate.  The amount of dust and dog hair it picks up is amazing.  It is a little louder than I expected and crashes into things more than I thought it would, but overall it does a great job."
5/11/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Piece of garbage,"This thing broke after about a month of use, definitely do not purchase it.  This has no durability, certainly not worth the price."
9/6/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,waste of money and electricity,"This stupid device is just that - incredibly stupid. I don't know what sort of logic the roomba uses to calculate that it has done its job, but it is clearly flawed. In the *rare* occasions that the roomba has ever completed its cycles, I always see leftover instances of dirt, hair, dust, etc in random spots. Moreover: - If you don't have furniture with long legs (at least 6 inches of clearance) or very low furniture (i.e. no more than 2 inches of clearance), do NOT waste your money or time. This device loves to get trapped under furniture and will never finish cleaning the room. - If the room has any floor mats or rugs, the roomba will get stuck and never finish cleaning the room. - If the base of your floor lamp or fan is less than 3 inches high, the roomba will likely get stuck trying to go over it and never finish cleaning the room. - If you do not have your charging base and its related power adapter secured properly (i.e. making it roomba-proof), the roomba is likely going to die wandering around the room. It will not be able to find the dock that it stupidly relocated (and possibly disconnected from power source) and will never be able to recharge. - If you don't replace your batteries for the virtual walls frequently (at least monthly), the roomba will wander off to where it shouldn't and die.Save your money and just get a reliable broom. You will *easily* clean the room faster & better than *any* roomba. It will cost you far less money and use far less electricity, and make far less noise. AND you will get some exercise."
11/17/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,This roomba is the best!!!
12/30/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roombas are AWESOME,"This Roomba is great! I have two dogs, and it's tough to keep up on vacuuming.  This unit allows me to schedule it to clean while I sleep, so when I wake up, all I have to do is clean out the tray.  I have it scheduled to vacuum 3 nights a week, and it finds quite a bit of dust and hair!On a side note, I had an allergy test done that said my biggest allergy is to dust. Any time my Roomba cleans, the next morning, my house feels so much cleaner, and my allergies feel so much better."
12/8/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,WOW what a difference !,"This Roomba is exactly what I needed.  I have #3 pets that shed terribly and was vacuuming almost everyday to keep up with all the shedding.  I now schedule the Roomba to run 7 days a week and it is amazing how much hair this thing picks up.I don't have to vacuum nearly as much and my wooden floors / carpet look great all the time.  As others have written, you do have to  declutter the  floors so it won't get stuck.You do have to empty and clean after each use which takes a couple of minutes.  Not a problem.Is it worth the money?  Well I wish it was cheaper so I could buy a couple more,  however it has saved me time, which is worth a lot."
9/27/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Big improvement over early Roomba models! Keeps the dog hair in check.,"This Roomba is changing our life. We had a 1st-gen Roomba years ago, but this is a vast improvement. It hasn't gotten stuck, has found the dock every time, and, most importantly, it seems to be heavier than the old models, which gives it much better traction when climbing onto area rugs, etc. Still need to touch up our area rugs weekly, but this is conquering all of the dog hair on our wood floors and our wall-to-wall carpeted bedroom. Haven't set up the scheduling feature, yet, so I can't comment on that. Right now we're alternating days between our living room/hall/kitchen and our bedroom (1000 sf apt.)not because it couldn't necessarily clean both in one shot, but because our dog is terrified of it, and we need to give her a refuge from it so she doesn't have a heart attack."
10/26/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Picks up dog hair!,"This Roomba has saved my sanity.  Cleans up doghair!  You definitely have to empty it daily, and it will not replace a ""real"" vacuum cleaner - but I no longer have dust bunnies."
4/6/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great for cat hair,"This Roomba has saved me so much time. It gets most of the cat hair from my four cats. I have dark hardwood floors, and the white cat hairs really show up. I love sitting around while it does the work, or coming home to a fresh floor if I left it set to run automatically. The dust bin is easy to dump. I do find it works better if I confine it to part of the house, and run again in a different section. The entire house is about 2300 sq ft. I can easily divide it into 3 different areas, and run the Roomba in one section at a time. I have tile and carpet and bathroom rugs as well as hardwood, and it handles all those surfaces just fine."
3/8/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Just about Flawless.,"This Roomba eliminates the annoyances I had with my previous 500 series model.  First, the brushes are a lot easier to clean and maintain.  Second, unlike my old Roomba, it doesn't pick up dust bunnies only to scrape them off along the edges of my rugs.  Third, it seems to cover more area in one session as it runs about an hour and a half before docking itself.I have an 1160 square ft. loft space with polished concrete floors and three large low-pile rugs.  I schedule Roomba to run M, W, F, at 11 pm. After the first night, I mostly sleep through the humming sound and actually if I awaken and hear it, rather than annoy, I feel soothed, knowing 'a little robot elf' is sprucing up the joint while I sleep.  My only complaint at this point is that it doesn't do windows...I keep a virtual wall near the cat's water bowl, mindful that water and Roomba are not friends.  For my space Roomba is perfect.  I haven't vacuumed in months and my crib is spotless."
12/17/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,great time saver,"This roomba does vacuum for approximately two hours and has only gotten hung up once.  It got in a corner and couldnt get out.  It really does pick up the dust.  I'm not sure I like the change in the filter set up or the cost of filters but I believe they are the hepa filters.  Much more expensive, but I am impressed with its results.  It does a good job."
9/29/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Roomba 650,This Roomba does a great job getting up the pet hair!
1/24/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Robot for a Busy Neatfreak,This robot keeps my place clear of cat hair. I have it programmed to run 4X a week while I am at work. Means I get to spend more time enjoying my weekends and less time cleaning.
2/27/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,This Robot is amazing. I love it. This became my personal assistant.
8/22/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Amazingly Useful,"This robot didn't disappoint me and my girlfriend at all. Even my mother bought one for her and my grandma after I showed it to them. It will clean the superficial dirt very well, what includes hair and light dust. However, it is not a permanent replacement for the vacuum because it won't pick the heavier, thin dust that sits in the bottom surface of the carpet. My only complaint is that it will avoid some dark colored spots in the carpet thinking that there is a cliff. I did try covering the cliff sensors, but then it won't work. In the video for this review you can see how it keeps backing up when encounters darker patterns on my center rug. If your carpet or floor happens to have high contrast patterns I'd recommend you to test Roomba there as soon as you get it to make sure that it will work for you. This old issue is briefly mentioned in the User Manual."
11/29/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,"Although the vacuuming is very good, I'm very disappointed that I now have to ...","This product should be recalled, as the black body of the Roomba 650 leaves marks on white trim as it navigates the room, dragging and bumping against the walls and/or trim pieces.  I complained to iRobot, which sent me white strips of plastic as a sort of bumper to mitigate this risk.  The trim pieces fell off after a week.  Although the vacuuming is very good, I'm very disappointed that I now have to repaint all my trim pieces in 4 rooms, an expensive proposition.  I cannot recommend this product, especially if you have wall trim painted in white, because it will do significant damage to your paint.  The black marks left by the Roomba do NOT clean off, either."
12/19/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Better technology than before,This product replaced a 1st generation Roomba. Love this thing! Will buy another for the second floor of my home.
6/9/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,excellent,This product really works. Gets the floors very clean
12/27/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Just terrible. Hire a cheap maid instead.,"This product needs to be completely redesigned and re engineered from the ground up. In this age of wifi there is no reason for this product to rely on impact and line of sight to operate.If you have an empty 10x10 room and 30 minutes to clean (or 5 minutes with a regular vacuum) then this is for you.  If you live in a house that actually has a floor plan layout, you're SOL. Yes, it does pick up dirt, but so does my sock. It randomly bounces around and become completely transfixed by certain areas in the room. The area under our table and chairs is immaculate, for example.It does NOT learn your floor plan. It does NOT remember where it has been. It doesn't NOT remember the dock location.This might have been cool 10 years ago but with smart devices and the Internet of things prevalent in today's appliances this thing is simply too primitive.And WAY TOO LOUD!Buy a cheap bare floor vac for $50 and spend a little time cleaning."
7/12/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This has made my life easier,this product makes my life easier. my dog sheds like crazy and this has cut down my vacuuming and makes my wife happy! happy wife happy life. worth the money and will get another one if this one every dies but we have had it for 9 months and its still going strong. I put some bumper pads on mine so it doesn't ding my wood furniture just a word of advice.
12/24/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,If it only did the dishes...,"This product is fantastic -- a giant leap into the future.  It does the job, then recharges itself -- love, love, love it."
4/7/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Works so well!  Perfect to keep pet hair in check.,"This product is awesome!  It works great.  We have two cats and lots of hardwood.  It really gets the job done.  What surprised me was how well it does on carpet.  It also has no problem navigating some of the rough transitions, room to room in the house.  I only wish we had gotten it sooner."
1/28/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,LOVE it keeps my house cleaner and helps tremendously with allergies!,"This product is amazing! I was very in between about getting one, but after having it, I will always own one.We live in the country where it is constantly dusty and there is always sand and dirt getting brought in. I was constantly sweeping and vacuuming trying to keep the floor clean and it was driving me crazy. After using this the very first time, I was so shocked at how much it had picked up. When I first ran it, I thought my floors were pretty clean, but after it was done cleaning, the bin was full of dust and dirt that my broom and vacuum weren't picking up. I was amazed. This has helped tremendously with my allergies by all the dust it picks up, that I was unable to get.I have hardwood floors as well as carpet and rugs down and it transitions over all of those perfectly and still cleans the same on all surfaces.It is great at detecting things on the floor, like children toys, furniture, phone cords, etc. and avoids them or if it happens to pick something up, it knows to spit it back out. I have had it pick up a few small toys and a phone cord and none were damaged, I was able to release them easily and in perfect condition.My floors are way cleaner now then they ever were before.Easy to use and has features where you can schedule your cleaning for whenever you want.I LOVE this product and don't have any complaints."
9/14/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,LOVE IT,"This may be the best thing I have ever purchased. I have no idea what the negative reviews are about. Our house is an open concept and we turn it it on and let it run. I sometimes put carpet powder down and when it's done, all the powder is gone so I know it's working. My house is about 3500 square feet and I have to run it on 3 separate charges to clean the whole house so I am thinking about getting another. It always comes back with a full bin, which is great but gross at the same time. LOVE IT"
7/22/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Works perfect!!!,This makes two that I own.The first one I have had for about 4 years and still works great.This one seems to be just as good with a few extras.
6/29/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing machine!,"This machine is amazing ... I have run it once a day for a week and my home feels so clean. Our two dogs shed PROFUSELY and keeping up with the dog hair has been a challenge, sweeping and vacuuming every day. Not only are my hardwood floors, tile floors and carpet clean as a whistle, the dust level in the house has been dramatically reduced. The surfaces under my bed and furniture are spotless. This little guy is very quiet .... just does its thing and goes back to its docking station when done. I can't say enough about it."
2/22/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Works as advertised and my wife's favorite gift ever.,This little sucker works - pulls in pet hair and dust without a problem.  I does need to be cleaned after each use as the filter box is not that big.  Great having an auto-vacuum to keep floors and carpets free of dust and pet hair.
1/2/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"I feel so lazy, but I don't care!","This little robot might make me officially lazy, but it also makes my carpet so much cleaner on a consistent basis. I now ""vacuum"" daily, rather than weekly (after much procrastination, grumping, and general dragging of feet). It is so easy. You dump the rubbish bin out of the butt end of the robot, make sure the rollers aren't covered in hair, and hit a button. Maintenance is simple enough -- clean out any snags on the removeable rollers and check the wheels for hair wads. No prob.I thought the Roomba might be a novelty that I get sick of, but this thing really, really works. I have two cats and a partner with long hair, so fur tends to accumulate quickly around here. This little robot is a lifesaver. The fur gets swept up without much effort from me, and the cats get a little workout chasing (or feeling chased, depending on which cat we're talking about) roomba around the house.Highly recommended. Pet owners, get one of the pet models like this one."
12/13/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,this little robot is amazing especially with our yellow lab.  cleans corners base board ect. its incredible!
1/4/16,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"We Love ""Hazel""","This little robot has made life much easier. My shiny kitchen floor was a magnet for dust and debris. In the morning I would swear there were little gremlins that came out each night and partied. ""Hazel"" takes care of all that for me now. She goes to work about five every morning and when I come downstairs at seven she has everything looking perfect. I set her to work under the bed a couple times a week and for the first time in a long time I have no dust bunnies under there. Like the real Hazel on the TV series she's not without her opinions. Apparently one day she thought I wasn't doing a good job in the living and dining rooms and she pushed aside the virtual wall and cleaned those as well. I have to admit that they did look great. She's also not a quiet, meek little thing. She makes her presence known by banging around some mornings and has an ongoing disagreement with the kitchen floor registers; she thinks they should be closed. She has gotten herself into a jam a couple times by getting stuck under the china cabinet or couch but is too proud to call for help. I just find her quietly waiting for me to free her.  Overall, she's a great addition to the family; I just wonder how long it will be before she asks for a raise."
2/14/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This little machine is the real deal. I have ...,"This little machine is the real deal. I have hard wood floors, a German Shepard, and a cat.  The animal hair dust balls drifting around the house are a thing of the past. I even have a small door frame ledge that Thomas (which is what I named him) intrepidly climbs over to get to the computer room.  I'm starting cat Roomba riding training later this week, will report back on results. I sweep religiously, but Thomas is much more serious about dust management, as the picture below indicates (one Roomba sweeping cycle):"
12/4/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Very easy for initial setup,"This little guy gets the job done. Very easy for initial setup. I have a scheduled run at midnight every night and typically run him once during the day. His tray always fills up, even though I vacuum on my own (with a dyson). He has always found his way back to the dock, which was one thing I was worried about based on reading reviews before hand and my placement of the dock (beneath an end table in the living room, only one way in and out) The cleaning method the Roomba takes seems to be sporadic at best, but can't argue with the results."
5/2/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This little gem is amazing. I could not believe how much dirt and ...,This little gem is amazing. I could not believe how much dirt and dust it picks up. I love it!
4/2/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Must have for excessively shedding pet owners.,"This little gadget is worth its weight in gold.  I run it just about every time it has a full charge.  I have two dogs that seemingly shed their body weight on a daily basis and this little vacuum somehow manages to keep up.  I have noticed a HUGE difference in dust in the house and hair on the carpet since I've owned this.I run it on both tile and carpet without issue.  It does a pretty good job of returning home to charge, although it occasionally gets stuck under one of my end tables. I tear it down and clean the brushes and sensors once a week.  It comes with an extra filter, I during my weekly cleaning I pull the filter out and gently clean it with some warm water and run the Roomba with the other filter while the first one is drying.  I'm considering buying another one two be able to vacuum both floors at the same time."
7/1/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"If you don't own one of these, you're wasting your time!","This is without a doubt one of the greatest purchases I've ever made.  I'm self-employed and tend to work very long hours which lends little time to small tasks around the house.  I simply schedule my Roomba for 2:00pm everyday and he does the rest.  Does great with pet hair, dust, dog food, and just about everything else!  I don't have to do that weird thing anymore where the bottom of one foot brushes of the top of the other after walking on my hardwood floors...  The only down side to this that I wish I would have known is the Roomba will only clean 1 room at a time, but if you just set him up and let him do his thing, you can come back to him in 30 min or so and the room is clean!  You can then just move him to another room and let him do the dirty work.  EVERYONE SHOULD OWN ONE OF THESE!"
6/2/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Undoubtedly the best household purchase I've ever made,"This is undoubtedly the best household purchase I've ever made.  I have a long-haired chihuahua and a pug, both of whom shed fine white hair copiously.  I was vacuuming the house several times a week to keep on top of the dog hair and dust balls.  Though I still find I have to run the Roomba a couple times a week to stay on top of the problem, at least my time is not caught up in the endless task of vacuuming!  An added plus of Roomba's industry is that I find that hearing my little iRobot at work serves as a motivating force for me to join in on the cleaning effort, say, by polishing the furniture!  The amount of hair and dust iRobot picks up each time is just astounding, and makes me the more appreciative of having this new feature in my life.  I can only imagine that my previous vacuum was only scratching the surface of the detritus that needed to be removed. I feel confident that iRobot is slowly, but surely making measurable improvement in my surroundings - including my air quality!  If there was ever a counterpart to the movie, Her, where the protagonist falls in love with his operating system, this could be it - a housewife falling in love with the obedient, helpful, silent butler of a robotic vacuum cleaner!"
6/21/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Great product, Just leave it on and let it do its trick !","This is truly a great product. We were going to get the Dyson and one of our friends told us to buy the Roomba. At first we were skeptical but went ahead with it. WOW. Thank god we didn't get the dyson and bought the Roomba instead. Makes life so much easier. This thing picks up dirt that you can't imagine. It's easy, simple, and a really high quality product. It knows where to go, has sensor technology to slowly approach walls so don't worry about any scratches, chips or dents. It maps out your entire home area and keeps cleaning. No more lower-back pain whenever you vacuum your house ! You can clean your house everyday if you like while focusing on other things, just switch it on and it will clean for hours. Highly recommended. Get it, don't over think it."
4/3/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Third Roomba we've owned- much improved,"This is the third Roomba we've owned since the original came out years ago.  Those were nice, but the improvements to the brushes and dirt chamber make this one a real winner.  The vacuuming power is much improved.  We spend less time cleaning it, and it does a much better job at cleaning!  We are so glad we got this one.  We just hope it lasts a little longer than our first two, which experienced logic board failures and the like after just a couple of years."
9/23/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great invention!,"This is the second one I have had! It is great to set and go. I have mine set to run each morning after I have left for work and get home to a clean floor. I have birds and they  are forever dumping food on the floor, with this I  do not have to sweep it multiple times daily"

If I knew how much help this would be for our family I would have bought it earlier.And It does work, I am surprised how much dust is present in the apartment. We do not have animals, during the winter months we rarely open the windows but still by the end of the week we get a full bag of dust , with the robot working 5 days for 1 hour/day."

12/11/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Two of my Sons bought them and after seeing how they worked I wanted one and am so far very happy with it,"This is the first robotic vacuum cleaner I have bought. Two of my Sons bought them and after seeing how they worked I wanted one and am so far very happy with it. The 650 cleans better than what I ever expected, I have 2 cats and it picks up the cat fur extremely well. My carpets are pretty old and worn out but the 650 has made them look a lot better. The 650 also picks up pretty much everything off my kitchen floor and has made housework a lot easier. The battery life is very good, so far no complaints. A couple of important points if you are considering one, make sure you empty the waste container after each use...it does fill up pretty fast. Follow the maintenance instructions and this will work fine. If you don't clean the brushes regularly, especially if you have cat hair or dog fur then it will not function well. This is a terrific product and am very happy with it!"

This machine is such a time saver and is a little tank!  Keeping the floors clean reduces the dust on everything else.  We've programmed it to run every morning.  The kids carry it upstairs - it's so lightweight.  It knows to stop at the stairs and we didn't purchase any virtual baby gate for it.  I am saving to get one for my 95 year old Grandma.  She is going to love it and I'm so happy to get her something to help ease her worry of being unable to have her house cleaned as she would prefer.  So long stinky perfumes, scarves and sweaters - she's about to have a new pet (as our kids would say)."

6/29/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,iRobot Roomba 650,This is the best vacuum ever! Picks up the pet hair great and saves me a lot of time and work. And when the battery gets low the robot automatically returns to the charging station so you do not have to do this. I am amazed and happy!
2/6/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,LIFE CHANGING,This is the best thing I've ever received as a gift.  Truly life changing for a mother of 2 & German Shepherd!  Trust me you need this!
3/18/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Best purchase ever,"This is the best thing I have ever bought in my life, and I am almost 50. Mittens inspires everyone to keep the house picked up, which is amazing. I was just about to hire a maid to come clean my apartment each week, but I thought I'd try this first. I just can't believe how clean my whole place stays.  It takes about one second a day to empty the dirt thing. Literally in the time it took me to get my big vacuum out of the closet and plugged in, I could do a whole weeks' worth of maintenance.  It was really easy to program, like a monkey could do it. Just hold the button down. I LOVE coming home to clean floors. It's just such a relief to not have to vacuum all the time.  My son watched it work one day and said it didn't seem very efficient. Who cares? When he was little I used to let him ""help"" me clean the house by running the vacuum. I figured, whatever he accomplished was more than I would have accomplished by not vacuuming that day.  Same with this thing. So it doesn't get every square inch every day. It will get done.  I've had it for about 2 months and I know I will always have one. I've wanted one since they came out and I'm so happy with this purchase!"
1/28/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Your life will be forever changed.,"This is the best thing ever created, and this is the cheapest version! I have heard of Roomba's for years and have always wanted to get one but didnt want to pay for it. When he arrived he was bigger than I thought he would be, pleasant surprise. We ended up naming him Trevor. You cant just call it ""The Roomba"". Despite the angelic female voice that comes out of him when he gets a cord in his mouth, he is very manly and fits into our 3 male cat household splendidly.So yes, he does pick up cords sometimes so that is a downfall. I have a skinny ipad cord he ran around with for a bit but when I took it from him it was unharmed--- If you have pets I guarantee they have caused more damage to your prized possessions than little Trevor could ever do.Pros:-Our cats are terrified of the real vacuum and act like a tragic death is imminent. Trevor is noisy but they just move out of the way in a annoyed way.-Can be programmed to run anytime you desire- 2am is our set time.-Can press clean and do an extra run anytime-Trevor returns to base to charge himself when he is getting low battery.-Gives you a full weekend of excitement when you first get him, i cancelled all my plans and just bonded with Trevor.-Returning home after a long day at work to a clean house has never been so good, unless you have a stay at home wife that cooks.-Is able to get the corners and that disgusting space in the kitchen between the linoleum and baseboards where food particles like to rot.-Wont fall down stairs- I stood at the edge of the stairs watching him, sweating and heart pounding because he races to the edge but then slams to a stop just in time. No need to be a helicopter parent with this guy!-He goes under beds and couches, if you have seen Arrested Development the tv show, you will know what I am thinking/laughing about.-A friend actually said our carpet looks a different color. How embarrassing but just provides evidence of the cleaning power of Trevor the Roomba.Cons:None of the cons are a reason not to get one.-Pick up cords or push against the wall out of the way.-Empty filter (halfway through cycle if you have a lot of pets)-Due to his cleaning noise, turn the tv/radio up and annoy your neighbors-May interrupt your cats precious 22 hour nap time.-Your dog may bark at it but that just means you need do a little more training."
2/19/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Best investment,This is the BEST investment I ever made.  Easy to use and easy to clean.Area rugs? no problem. Good customer service. 100% satisfied.  Strongly recommend to anyonewho is tired of vacuum floor everyday.
8/2/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I dont have to vaccum!,"This is the best invention ever!We have 1 cat, 1 dog, and 2 bunnies. We have a 3 story house. I rotate this roomba a couple times a week to each level. It will clean 1 level perfect on 1 charge, approximately 1,000 sq ft."
12/11/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,In short - I LOVE THIS THING,"This is the best gift I have ever bought for myself. If I were wealthy, I would buy one for everyone I love! THANK YOU to amazon.com for encouraging the peer review process and my fellow consumers for sharing your experiences. I read dozens, perhaps even hundreds of reviews before I bought this. It just seems too good to be true! I read the 5 star reviews, the 1 star reviews, and the detailed, 3-star reviews because that is where you really get to the heart of the pros and cons. I compared every brand of robot vacuum and once I decided Roomba was for me, I compared all of the different models and read multiple reviews on each of the features. Therefore, I had very realistic expectations and I am happy to say our little Roo has surpassed all of them!Many people said you have to babysit it the first couple of times it runs to see what it will get caught up on, and this is absolutely true, but is not a burden because its process is fascinating. We've had it for a month now, set to automatically run before we get up each morning, so I clean the brushes before I go to bed each night. Rooms that would normally not be vacuumed more than a couple of times a year (teenagers' bedrooms) are being vacuumed weekly now! The original color of the carpeting is beginning to show again!One very cool thing it does is when it gets to an edge, like the top of the stairs, the cliff sensors tell it to stop. Then it will gently approach the edge, all along it, to get a sense of how big it is. Then it will repeatedly fling itself at the edge with a ""running start"" and stop at the last second so abruptly that the back end lifts off the floor so it cleans all the way to the very edge of the ""cliff"". Such commitment! :D"
9/8/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Note - the device is designed to be cleaned easily and cleaning it needs frequently,This is the answer to my prayers!  I have two dogs - one being a husky - and I have had to deal with excessive dog hair.No more - this Roomba takes care of it for me.  Note - the device is designed to be cleaned easily and cleaning it needs frequently!  Not a problem to me and sure beats the alternative - I love this product!
12/15/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Waste of Money,This is supposed to clean dog hair and clean your entire room.  This vacuum goes back and forth over the same spots and never picks up the dog hair just spreads it evenly over the carpet.  It gets stuck under our couch and on the change from carpet to wood floors.  Every time I start it it is a game to see where it got stuck and stopped working.  I wish I could return it.  Total waste of our money.
3/25/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba is my girlfriend.,"This is such a lifesaver! We have a dog business and there is always mounds of dog hair around the house. Roomba takes care of all of it! We empty the filter after every use just so we don't overwork it, but no complaints here!"
2/5/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great Product!!!,"This is really a good product. We have 2 cats and 1 dog and they all shed a lot. We have dark hardwoods, dark carpet, and light tile. I was a little leery ordering the Roomba, because I wasn't sure that it would clean with the thoroughness that I desired, but I have to admit that it met my standards. I was concerned with it's random patterns at first, but I realized after a while that even though the cleaning patterns aren't that efficient, it does them so long that it eventually cleans everything.On carpet, it doesn't appear to have the suction power that our standard vacuum has, but it gets under beds and furniture which is a plus. Also, it vacuums from so many different angles and for longer than I would spend vacuuming, so in the end, the floors wind up just as clean as a standard vacuum.On hard surfaces (hardwood, tile, etc.), it does excellent. It seems to be set up just right for these types of surfaces. NOTE: We don't have grooves in our hardwood. I'm not sure how well it would do getting dust out of grooves, but it does do well on our tile and tile grout.Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase. If you have animals, I would highly recommend this product. The price is a little high, but as long as I get several years (4 or more) out of it, I would definitely buy this product again."
6/16/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Two years of service,"This is quite possibly the best appliance for which I have plunked down my credit card.  A housekeeper I am not - and there is no way I would have the spare cash to pay a nice lady to come in every week to run my Hoover about sucking up the mounds of pet hair that my over-appreciated Great Dane shakes off in clouds. After I moved into my new home in the USA, I got an estimate: $80 per four hour day plus car fare. Now admittedly, that included cleaning the baths and the kitchen, and dusting. But not the windows or the laundry, changing linens or beds. I admit to being spoiled - I had a weekly housecleaner in my former home one day a week for $250 a month - she did everything, including all the washing, ironing, etc.After hovering the place a couple of times myself, I knew that this was not my calling - and so, bought this little gem on a lark - who knows, it might just be worth a try.Now, almost two years later, I am totally hooked. The Roomba has done its fascinating blunder every morning at 6 am while I shower and dress, walk the dog and make coffee. It occasionally gets stuck on a piece of clothing tossed carelessly on the floor, or a lamp wire trailing on the floor, or one of the dog blankets. and sometimes can't find its way back to the charging station - the house is big, about 2500 sq ft of hardwood everywhere but the bedrooms, and I leave the guest bedroom doors open. Biggest trap is the dining chairs - it sometimes moves chairs about in such a way that it can't find a way out of the forest - but I know where to look when it isn't on the recharging station.I installed a ""soft pad"" on the bumper, just a 1/4"" rubber tube that juts out and compresses on impact with chair legs to cushion the blow. I did this after the Roomba managed to crack the glue on a few antique chairs after pounding away - like a fifteen pound hammer - until the dowels pulled apart. That solved the problem, no more damage - although it can be a bit disconcerting to see dining chairs moving a centimeter at a time as the Roomba pushes unseen at the legs..Yes, I have to remember to empty the bin every other day - but it's an easy habit to follow, and I'm always amazed by the amount of hair, biscuit crumbs, flotsam and jetsam that tumbles out. An occasional paperclip, pieces of paper, a pea, bits of styrofoam from packing materials that I missed seeing because I'm too lazy to wear glasses unless one of those blasted packaged food cartons is printed in green on a dark blue background in tiny print.The upshot is - I have a nice lady come in just twice a month to clean, she never has to hoover more than a few minutes, mostly in the areas the Roomba can't reach, like inside the larder, under the sofas and nightstands, behind the sectional seating in the living - and the dustbag only needs changing every couple of months. The floors are spotless (I also bought a Braava thingy that damp mops the hardwood and the tile floors in the baths every couple of weeks), and I figure the Roomba paid for itself in the first four months - including the costs of new filters every month, new swish brushes,, a new battery after two years and new rollers every six months, and a few dollars in electricity to recharge the battery, it costs only $15 a month to run.The dog now ignores the Roomba - just lays on one of  her big pillows and watches it bounce off things. Some say it is loud - but frankly, what are they expecting?  It isn't a loud as the big Hoover, or even the coffee grinder, and at 6 am who cares?Yes, I have to pick up, no clothes left in a pile in the bathroom or next to the bed. And I shut it off when overnight guests first arrive. BUT - no dust bunnies under the beds, floors ready for guests at any time, my brother who's allergic to pet dander and dust has no trouble when visiting, and if I want to sleep in,  there's a remote in the nightstand. As if my dog would let me wait too long - the Roomba won't take her out, and the other half has no intention of walking her before noon, would sleep through twelve Roombas in concert, snoring away blissfully.If this Roomba ever gives up the ghost, I'll gladly upgrade to the new top-of-the-line pet model - worth every penny. But it will be a sad day, laying the faithful little guy to rest."
1/26/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Good only in theory,"This is probably the least efficient way to vacuum.  It had a habit of going over and over the same area and when it did, it either just pushed around the dirt or didn't even pick it up.  We let it run fully charged when we left the house and even after a couple of hours it left about 50% of the dirt in an average size room.  I think I'll just stick with my little $15 Bissell 3 in 1 vac.  Best $15 investment I ever made in a vacuum."
7/25/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great Value.  Labor Saving.  Like having a cleaning service without having to supervise.,This is our third Roomba and it works as well as previous models in other homes.  The seek-and-return-to-charger-station feature is amazing.
7/30/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,... our third one over many years and it works better than any of the earlier versions,This is our third one over many years and it works better than any of the earlier versions.  We run it about every three days and it does a great job.  We have pets ion the house and it picks up a lot of pet hair.
12/29/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Our Third Robot over the years - We are highly satisfied.,"This is our third iRobot over the past eight years or so. We have had several models over the years. The 650 does a good job. Misses a few spots  occasion, but then so do I if I ever use a regular vacuum...which is maybe once a year.  The iRobot always does a good job. The 650 model will run for some 90 minutes non-stop before it needs to dock at its charging station. Well worth the money !  I would recommend the iRobot 650 to relatives, friends and neighbors."
7/9/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,You have to get this,"This is one of those items in life where you find yourself exclaiming, ""Why in the world did I not get this sooner?""I have dark wood floors, and used the swiffer on a daily basis.  Quite long ago (a few years after the emergence of Roomba), I had asked several Roomba owners for their opinion and what I normally heard was an unenthusiastic ""It's just ok.""  Hence I didn't bother purchasing one.Well, after 3 years of daily swiffer, I had had enough.  I did my share of research online, and have come to the conclusion that Roomba 650 would be most suitable.On my first use, I stared at the Roomba in disappointment as it looked to do a pretty sorry job not getting all the dust.  But I decided to stop staring after 15 minutes and left the apt.  When I returned, the floors were spotless.  This little machine has been a life changer.I do not use swiffer anymore.I certainly hope this wonderful machine lasts."
8/11/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Putting Cleaning Ladies out of Business.,This is one of the greatest technological achievements in human history. My house has never been cleaner. This thing is incredible! It got every speck of dust and dirt out of my basement.  I was also surprised that my puppy hasn't even barked once at it.
1/12/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great product,"This is one amazing device.  Cleans every inch of a room and does it well.  We've only had it for 1 month but no problems thus far.  There are some other models with more bells and whistles, but I can't see at this point how much is gained by those.  The 650 works great and just requires the push of a button"
3/18/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,keeps the dust and hair controlled,"This is not meant to take the place of heavy duty vacuuming but it keeps the hair and dust down substantially.  It is not near as load as a vac. and the fact that you can schedule it when to vac, like when everyone is out of the house, is fabulous!  Each day or morning we empty out the filter collection, so easy.  I have wanted one of these ever since one of my friends had one in her home, and she had tile floors throughout the house, except for the bedrooms.  Plus, she had two cats, yeup it definitely made a difference.  I choose this over the other brand mainly because of the reviews about the motor not being protected or sealed off from catching any hair.  Other reviewers who had purchased the more expensive model still rated this with 4.5 to 5 stars."
7/20/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"A must have for all pet owners, REALLY!!!!","This is my third roomba. I love them, huge fan!!!! This particular newer model has a better intake vacuum system & motor, plus better brushes and the dust bin works more efficiently. You do have to thoroughly clean them with each use, but if you have pets, you will love this model. I just pick up the smaller things in the room, and push the clean button, and you comer home to a super clean carpet or floor. What's not to love!"
5/19/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it!,This is my third Roomba.  Love it!
11/30/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Eliminates pet hair from floors and carpets,"This is my second Roomba, and it works great. I purchased this one to put on the second floor of my house to complement the other Roomba that runs on the first floor. The Roomba is scheduled to run once a day and runs for about an hour. It covers multiple bedrooms and a hallway, and sometimes a bathroom. It works well on carpet, hardwood, and tile. We have 1 dog (a shedding Lab) and 2 cats, and it has eliminated most of the pet hair issues we had around the floors of the house. It vacuums under beds and other furniture, and usually finds its way back to its charging dock when it is done. Occasionally it will get behind a door and push the door shut, trapping itself in that room. It fills its bin with mostly dog hair. I try to empty its bin every day, but it has occasionally run 3 days without being emptied, and worked just fine. It is very easy to empty the bin and emptying it takes less than a minute. The roller and brush only need to be cleaned about once a week - usually due to my daughter's long hair being twisted in them. Cleaning the roller and brush to clean takes about 3 or 4 minutes using the round cleaning tool. You can schedule it to run once a day, and it runs for about an hour each time. It is very easy to schedule. I have ours run when no one is home, because while it is not loud, the noise can be a bit distracting."
6/15/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Great ""Ms. Rosie"" robot!",This is my new best friend! Just let it go and it gets the job done.
12/11/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,Five-Star Product with a Fatal Flaw,"This is my kind of appliance and I basically love it, but it has one fatal flaw:  It is constantly getting stuck in the toe space of my base cabinets.  Wherever there is a rug in front of a base cabinet, for example by the kitchen sink or the guest bath vanity, there is not adequate space for the Roomba to fit.  When it encounters these spots, instead of backing off and moving on, it will ram, and ram, and ram itself into the space until it is permanently stuck there.  This is where I will find it when I get home from work.  On the days it is scheduled to run, I have to make sure all those rugs are folded up to keep the device away.  When I am home and can babysit it, I usually leave the rugs flat.  When it gets stuck and I remove it from the toe space,  it will often go right back to the same spot and ram itself stuck again.  I have to dislodge it sometimes three or four times in a cycle.  I am not sure if the firmware can be updated, but this is something that iRobot needs to address.  I should not have to redecorate the house to accommodate the Roomba.While this problem is major, I have no other complaints about the device.  It is easy to set up and program.  It nimbly negotiates area rugs on hardwood floors.  My house has never been cleaner.  I like a clean house, but I hate vacuuming it.  This thing fits my lifestyle perfectly.The first few times I ran it, the dust bin ended up chock full.  Now I just get a little ""chignon"" of dust each time it runs, so it is obviously doing the job.  A couple days a week, I stick it up in the bedroom.  I get a kick out of how it goes under the bed and gets that cleaned as well.  That never got vacuumed before (ahem!).If the base cabinet toe space problem could be solved, I would readily give it five stars."
4/9/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Better than the 500 series Roomba's,"This is my fourth iRobot Roomba, so obviously I like them.  The other three are the older 500 series model, only one of which is programmable.  Unfortunately one of the older ones died (would only go around and around in a circle), and the other older one the battery is dying on, so I'm almost down to this one and the other programmable one I have.This 650 Roomba is much better than the previous versions and the filter holds more dirt.  It's also easier to clean and the brushes don't get as filthy.  I have used it for a few months now.  Most of the time it doesn't get stuck and finds its way back ""home"" to the charging base.  However, if there are cords or things like stationary fans in the way it can get stuck on them and I come home to either a dead battery or the robot beeping a message.  At times it dies before getting ""home"".  It is programmable and here's the reason I haven't programmed it - whenever I heard my other programmable Roomba start up I'd have to go and stop it and clean it.  I know, you're supposed to clean it and empty the dust bin after it's done, but rarely did I remember to do that.  So, whenever I want to use it I first empty the dust bin, clean the brushes (don't clean the brushes over a garbage because the little yellow cover on one end of the brushes falls off into the garbage and I've had to dig in the dirt for it), and then I press the button to have it clean.  It comes with a virtual wall to keep it in a certain space if you want; I let it have full reign of the house because I figure what it doesn't clean one time it'll get the next.  This 650 also seems to run into walls more often, like it doesn't ""see"" that they're there.This is definitely a good tool to have (and fun to watch too; lol).  Unfortunately it's still not perfect, but it sure beats the alternative of having to actually vacuum!  ;-)"
10/4/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Good for keeping the floors presentable at all times,"This is my first robot vacuum so I can't compare with other models or brands. I find that this is great for the living room rug no longer being forever covered in cat fur, and the dining room floor no longer forever being covered in crumbs. It keeps the floors and rugs looking presentable at all times, instead of only immediately after a weekly cleaning. But it's not as good a vacuum as a good upright. I find that it's generally pretty good at staying out of trouble, we've had it for a couple of weeks now and only once did we come home and find it not sitting on its charger. It had gotten a charging cable tangled up in it, and had turned itself off. The cable was fine and so was the Roomba. It's also pretty good at covering all accessible areas, right up against walls, and most notably, underneath couches and tables and stuff where it's a pain to try and vacuum by hand. I read that the Roomba is supposed to map the floor space... I seriously doubt it's doing that. But I don't find that a detriment."
1/2/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,"Vacuums well, but is a rather dumb machine.","This is my first iRobot, it vacuums rather well, picks up lots of dog hair and overall does a decent job.  However there's a variety of problems with as I see it.  Primarily, this has to be one of the dumbest robots ever, it mindlessly moves around the house with no concept of any type of consistency or pattern.  It doesn't clean thoroughly, place it in a room and it may only vacuum a small portion of it, frequently going over the same spots.  In addition, if you have any black in your area rugs, carpet, it won't vacuum that as it detects anything black as being a cliff.Overall, it's just decent."
9/16/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it enough to buy a 2nd one!,"This is my 2nd Roomba that I bought for my son in law. With two dogs and two cats, they needed it!I bought the programmable one this time because I wished that I had that with mine.  The Roomba can get to places a typical vacuum an not easily reach.  Goes from floor surface to floor surface easily.  Amazing what it collects!"
8/20/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I love it. I was amazed about how much suction ...,"This is my 1st review ever!!  I read all the reviews and as most, very skeptical about spending this much money on something that sounds too god to be true.  I love it.  I was amazed about how much suction power this thing has for being battery operated.  I have dark (almost black) hardwoods, carpet and vinyl in our sunroom-it works great on all.  It goes over the area rugs nicely.  We both work from home, so we will usually turn up the barstools on the counters, chairs flipped over on the table and pick up around the house when we go out to dinner on Friday nights.  That's the most effort.  When I go get my son from school, I was turn it on just to see what it will do while I am away 30 mins.  Impressed!!  I have only done a deem cleaning twice. Which means, moving chairs and dust mopping all corners and places where Roomba cannot go-into middle of the room and then turn it on.  No more constantly b*tching about the floors and having to spend hours on Saturdays to clean them.  LOVE!"
11/30/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This is freaking awesome!! It not only picks up dust (fine ...,"This is freaking awesome!! It not only picks up dust (fine dust like my bag-less vacuum) and debris, but also CAT FUR (yes, so much that I have to clean out the motor after 2-uses), and CAT TOYS (lol)! It's worth every penny."
4/15/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Hail Our Drone Overlords,This is by far the greatest thing mankind has ever produced. I want 9 more.
5/28/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Don't wait to buy just buy it.,This Is by far the best thing I have ever bought on Amazon and nearly the best darn thing I have ever bought period. It is magical machine that I cant believe I waited so long to buy. My wife and I just had our first child and we found it difficult to keep up with the house like we wanted to. Then we bought a Roomba. We call it Hal. Hal is awesome. It cleans better then you can expect. We have transitions from carpet to wood and Hal handles them with zero problem. He charges himself automatically and will stay in an area longer if he senses it needs extra work. He will not fall down the steps and it is quieter then the average vacuum by far. The only thing left to do is waited for the rumba that mops floors. We love it we will always have a Roomba for ever.
12/10/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I love this more than anything in the world!,"This is by far one of the most amazing inventions since fire. We have two huge labs that shed like crazy, and we just had a baby. Who has time to clean their house, let a lone keep up with pet fur, plus your baby is always covered head to toe from crawling around in it.Buy this.I run this thing usually once a day. I close it off in the bedroom and let it go. Once I had one floor done (hardwood) I move it to another room and then I take my Bona mop and scrub, etc. etc. For the first time ever I am able to vacuum multiple times a week and scrub my floors once a week.Such a life saver. I did not buy the virtual walls  yet. I am running around blocking it in with a dog bed- but I'm just cheap for now. I will get them eventually. We have a super open floor plan so that is the only hard part. You should keep up with cleaning it once every three runs, if not more. That thing picks up so much dirt. Bought it at a department store on sale (which was the same price it was on Amazon) and it was a costly purchase so to determine if I wanted to keep it, I vacuumed my whole house with our vacuum and then ran the Roomba- SOLD. The carpets even smelled cleaner after it was done. I hope this thing lives for a long long time."
12/25/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Awesome.,This is awesome.
7/10/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing Product,This is an amazing product and worth the price! It works better than I thought and very modern looking. The only problem I have is that can get stuck under my kitchen toe kicks sometimes. But my floors basically stay clean now! P.S. A bit noisy so prefer running it when we are not home
7/13/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love!,"This is an amazing addition to our household. We have Flor carpet tiles throughout our home, two small children, a dog, and lots if open doors. Before Disco Velante, the name we gave our Roomba, our floors were always a bit dirty. Now they are ALWAYS spotless. We had to move the kitchen rug as he would get wedged between the rug and the base if the counters, but one 1/2 inch adjustment was all that was needed. Buy this."
3/13/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This works very well,"This is a well designed robot, it does a great job at cleaning hard floors and getting over and or around obstacles.  It is well made and super easy to figure out and program.  I am glad I bought it."
4/10/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba 650,"This is a very special product.It works very well, cleaning each little partof the fllor. Runs smooothly and it is easy to handle and clean."
6/23/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Terrible Design Flaw,"This is a terrible product.  I purchased it to help keep my wood floors clean.  It has scratched them, which will cost me a lot of money to fix. Poorly designed. I am returning it."
3/14/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Really good,This is a really good cleaner.  It sometimes needs resetting but you have to monitor it's can and cant's.
11/29/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,This is a problem!...Everybody likes it... Bought 4 so far... #5 coming up in Dec
10/21/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing,"This is a must have, the Roomba works great. It goes over rugs and stops at stairs, goes around things and just keeps going. It even goes ""home"" to recharge when the battery is low. You might still need a regular vacuum cleaner for corners and stairs etc, but this does the job on an every day basis. You will not believe how much dust and dirt gets collected in it. Easy to use and to clean. Our Roomba even went outside one time and sucked up leaves and small twigs... so keep your doors closed! Great item."
2/4/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This is a great thing to have in your house,This is a great thing to have in your house!  I use it all the time and it does a great job. It picks up dog hair pretty well also.  Love it!!
12/31/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This is a great product. If it runs a full cycle it ...,This is a great product. If it runs a full cycle it will get all areas. Picks up everything from dog hair to small toys.
10/25/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Very cool, smart, and worth it!","This is a great little helper to our need for a daily quick sweep.  It at times gets stuck in places, but most of the time it will find its way back to the docking station.  I find it easier to pick up anything on the floor such as loose carpets and clothes prior to it's scheduled 9:00 AM start time and as long as I clean out the trap each day, it works great.  Have to say; what a cool invention!"
1/17/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great,This is a great little device for shedding pet owners.  I am constantly amazed at the amount of hair it collects daily.  Be sure yo room a proof your house before using. It can pull appliances down if it gets tangled in power cords and can get trapped under furniture. Otherwise let it rip and it does a terrific job.
10/8/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,This is a good tool for a busy family,"This is a good tool for a busy family. However I cannot run this when I am not at home. It always gets stuck somewhere in the house and it needs to be rescued. I have Flor carpet which was hard to be cleaned with my regular vacuum, but Roomba does a very good job cleaning it. There are pros and cons but it's still useful for a lazy wife like me."
7/12/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I love it!,"This is a a great buy! I have needed this for a while, having a super-shedding English Bulldog!"
10/24/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I love it.,This iRobot Roomba work very well.  I love it.
12/10/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This irobot is amazing. I can't believe we actually used a vacuum ...,"This irobot is amazing.  I can't believe we actually used a vacuum before. The Roomba 650 exceeded my expectations in every way.  Our Roomba's Domain is our first floor which is an open concept about 700 square foot.  There are 3 area rugs, two area low profile but one is a high pile area rug with 1"" long or so fibers with a rug pad underneath, and tile everywhere else.  The roomba moves over and vacuums with ease on all of these surfaces.  It is quiet enough to watch TV at a moderate volume while you sit back and admire the work that it is doing that you don't have to.  In fact it works so well I may just buy another for upstairs.  One of the best purchases we have made.  You will not be disappointed."
5/23/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great product Love the way it works,"This I a great product.  No more dog hair in our house.  My wife is very impressed,  we all  notice the cleanness."
12/13/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It's almost like getting a maid but lots cheaper!,This has worked better than I could have imagined.  I read the reviews extensively and thought long and hard before paying this much for a battery powered vacuum cleaner but I can say after using it for 4 months it was worth every penny.  I feel like I got a maid!  It is set to run every day and most of the time I never know that it is working other than that the floors are just all clean.  I have nearly all hardwood floors and tile and they are cleaner than they have ever been and look great.  I have it covering most of my 2500 sq. ft. house.  Probably 3/4 of the time it cleans and re-docks itself.  Other times it does get stuck under the ledge of the cabinet in the kitchen which is just not quite tall enough or there are a couple of places that it gets into that it can't find it's way out.  Not really an issue though because you do have to remember to empty the dustbin anyway.  I recommend this to all my friends and if it ever goes out I'll definitely buy another.
11/24/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Don't wait any longer!,"This has turned out to be one of the best purchases I have ever made.  I run it everyday, as recommended.  It's easy to clean and rarely gets ""stuck"".  Our floors are so much cleaner.  I only wish I had gotten it sooner.  Anyone considering getting one of these needs to do it; don't wait any longer."
12/12/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I want to give more stars for my Roomba!,"This has got to be one of the best purchases anyone could ever make...whhhy would I choose a handheld???  I have my Roomba scheduled to run 4 days a week.  I have a long haired dog and a long haired cat.  The Roomba works beautifully!  I come home and the living room is perfect.  The only thing I have to do is remind myself to empty the dust tray and clean the brushes after every 2 runs...and make sure the kids take all toys off the floor every night so it doesn't suck up small parts.I have a busy life - single mom, 2 boys, work full-time, after school activities; homework, etc, etc, etc.  Vacuuming is now 1 less chore we have to worry about.Love it!"
9/28/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This has been the greatest purchase I have ever made,This has been the greatest purchase I have ever made. We have 6 animals and this little vacuum does such a great job with keeping up with all of the hair
12/17/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I highly recommend this product,"This has been a life saver cleaning up after  my corgi who sheds  non stop year around.  I only have to vacuum one a week my Roomba does the vacuuming for  me everyday.  I highly recommend this product, it is truly awesome."
12/14/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Amazing!,"This device really helps to keep the dust and pet hair down to a manageable level in our home. It works well on both carpet and tile and picks up virtually everything. Cons: It does get stuck in several places. Maybe in the future there will be a robot that can remember where it should avoid. If I don't start it from the base it often does not return to the base, but ends up stopping where it runs out of juice. The noise level is acceptable; somewhat quieter than our vacuum, but then it runs for a longer time. I was hoping to use it at night while we slept, but it's a little too loud for us.Cleaning: I use a HEPA mask and small needle nose pliers to unwind the pet hair from the numerous places where it gets caught. There are good suggestions on youtube and other places on ways to clean the filter (rather than replacing it) and do a deep cleaning. Removing the pet hair is not a fun chore and I find myself avoiding it in pretty much the same way I avoided vacuuming! The difference is that it really only takes about 10 minutes to maintain the Roomba after each use and my floors are much much cleaner."
7/20/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,This Roomba is perfect,"This beast is awesome, powerful and smart.. kind of loud but beats lugging a heavy vacuum around all day. This thing gets EVERYWHERE and I mean everywhere. It finished my bedroom in about 15 minutes and left behind nothing. It is also very powerful with suction and in general, it actually knocked down the gate we had up to the kitchen and rode over it like nothing. It gets under all our tables/chairs without issue and hugs the corners of our kitchen cabinets really nicely so it gets to those hard to reach spots. This thing is pretty great, I thought it would need a lot of ""moving it out of stuck areas"" but have not encountered that once yet. After we first used it in our living room to test it out, I was shocked to see the amount of dust/cat hair it sucked up - it was jam packed with it. We didn't even think the carpet looked dirty but apparently it was, the suction must be really great on this. Welcome to 2015, you don't have to vacuum yourself they have robots for that now! What is so great about this machine is how much work and detail went into making it perfect, it is designed so well I really have no complaints about it. And I rarely say that about anything."

8/1/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Curmudgeon approved - sort of.,"There's enough reviews here to probably sway the typical dirty floor denizen but I will chime in regardless because I was in a quandary over which Roomba to buy. It was an important decision as my relationship hinged on it's success. My wife hates dirty floors almost as much as me. Read that sentence any way you wish.So after reading a few online reviews I came to understand that the 650 was the sweet spot of price vs. features. I'm happy to have saved a few bucks and I think it works just great. I can walk around the house in bare feet and not feel dirt or crunchies. My wife, ever supportive and encouraging, simply shrugged, ""Meh, you still have to vacuum and wet mop..."" That comment was just to make sure she didn't have to thank me for doing something nice. The real proof is that she no longer vacuums - at all."

He gets 5 stars, not only for being so great at vacuuming (picked up a couple bins full of dust and fibers even after a preliminary Dyson once-over) but also for the unexpected psychological benefit of making me happier while I'm cleaning."
5/29/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Fabulous product!,"There are lots of revues for all the different models that iRobot markets. I am not going to repeat what others have said over and over again. My opinion is to find the one that sounds good and BUY IT!I am a very picky buyer. But I also have a dog that explodes hair as she walks across the room. See picture that I uploaded. It has become tiresome to go to the local club, buy some chick a couple drinks, and then talk her into going home with me just so I can get the floors vacuumed. The Roomba has allowed me to automate the cleaning process that will provided payback within the first couple of months. If they would add a feature that would bring me a beer and clean the bathrooms, I would pay even more.Here are a few observations:Noise is minimal. I have the Roomba set up to run on autopilot at 5:30 in the morning. I do not find the noise bothersome at all.Roomba does very well on hardwood and tile. Does okay on carpet but I use the heavy duty vacuum weekly just to get further down into the pile. Roomba does not like rug fringe. Roomba HATES black carpet. Apparently this tells Roomba that she is falling down stairs. She tries to go the other way most of the time but sometimes just stops. Roomba can get tangled in cords so you have to Roomba proof by typing the cords up or you can tape them to the floor. It sounds laborious but its really not when you consider the ongoing labor savings.Roomba likes to close doors as she moves around and will trap herself in the room. I solved this by getting door stops that are magnetic. I actually like them better because I frequently leave the windows open and the doors no longer slam shut with the wind. Do a search in Amazon for Magnetic door stops.One of the things that attracted me to Roomba is that she is short but fairly large around. She fits easily in that space designed for womens feet under the kitchen counter. Roomba very efficiently picks up the crumbs that tend to gather there. Her heft means that she brushes the floor fairly aggressively. The only draw-back is that Roomba will not fit under some chairs if there are too many legs in close proximity to each other. My work-around is that I put the dining chairs on the table first and pull the bar chairs away from the bar to give Roomba the tail-swing room she needs to get the job done. Roomba will also clumsily knock over any light plant stands.My Roomba came with only one Virtual wall. You really need two or three. The virtual walls keep Roomba on task in a particular area. She wont crawl past the electronic barrier. Do a search for Roomba Accessories on Amazon and order a 2-pack.I know this sounds weird but Roomba is FUN to watch work. She rather randomly bumbles around exploring the room and twirling her little bristles. I find it endlessly fascinating to try to figure out what is going on in her simple little mind.The best part of Roomba is opening up the dust bin and seeing all the crap that she picks up while you are fixing dinner or watching a movie. The first time I ran Roomba was right after my floors were cleaned and I was SHOCKED at how much she picked up.I am going to order a second Roomba for the lower level of my house. That's how much I like it!"
12/31/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Dead on Arrival,"The unit was well packaged and seemed to have a good fit and finish. However, upon following the setup instructions, the unit would only charge for a couple of minutes then begin flashing an error code.  One other thing to note is that, aside from the vacuum itself, this unit has a speaker which makes noise (various beeps and error message narration). The noises are loud, can't be disabled and can be quite unsettling at night when you hear your vacuum talking to you out of the blue."
12/17/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,the EARLIER you enjoy. No need to sweat cleaning the house everyday,"The thing with IROBOT is that the EARLIER  you buy, the EARLIER you enjoy.No need to sweat cleaning the house  everyday."
8/20/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Works very well, although not 100% perfect","The short version: The Roomba works very well, but there are some minor issues.The longer version:For context, I have a 2 bedroom apartment (roughly 800-900 sq) and it's just me and a short-haired cat.  So, there's a fair amount of dust and hair, but no giant kid-related messes or anything.  It's doable to vacuum on my own, but I just hate doing it, so I decided to give the Roomba a shot.Pros:-Does a surprisingly good job vacuuming.  Gets probably 95% of the visible stuff on the floor (see below for more on this).  I've run it about 5 times now in 3 days and it is still picking up handfuls of dust and cat hair.  I was vacuuming about once a week prior to getting the Roomba, so it's clearly picking up a lot that my old vacuum was not.-It goes under beds/couches, which basically never get done with a regular vacuum.-It's surprisingly quiet.  You can easily talk over it and even watching TV I found that I only have to increase the volume a couple notches.-Runs for well over an hour, probably close to 2 hours, without stopping.-Does a good job of untangling itself most of the time.  It does run over cords, but it can usually untangle itself.  So far there's only been one time when it got so tangled that I had to rescue it.  It does not get tangled in the tassels of my area rug.-Goes over hardwood, carpet, and tile seamlessly.-Navigates pretty well.  It bumps into stuff constantly, but it usually corrects itself quickly and goes on its way.Neutral:-I expected it to do one area completely and then move onto the next area, etc.  This is not how it works.  It'll do one area and then randomly go into a different area, then another area, then come back to the first area and stay there for 10 minutes, then go to a new area for a few swipes, then back to another area, etc etc etc.  Sometimes it'll come into a room for 30 seconds and then not come back for 30 minutes, other times it'll come into a room and not leave for 10 minutes.  It hits almost everywhere eventually though, so it's fine in the end.Cons:-It probably gets like 90-95% of the stuff on the floor, but it is not completely perfect.  After it's done, I'll still find little globs of dust or cat hair here and there.  This is totally fine for a normal day, but if I were having company over and wanted a 100% spotless house without a speck of dust, I'd probably do a once-over with the regular vacuum.-Sometimes it bumps into a things a little too hard.  It's not that hard, so this probably won't be a problem for most people, but I noticed it because I have a set of ladder bookshelves that have tipped over a couple times when bumped into the wrong way.  The Roomba has hit them a couple times, hard enough for them to shift slightly (not hard enough for them to knock over, yet).Overall, I am very glad that I purchased it.  My floors are visibly cleaner once it's done its thing and it has picked up a ridiculous amount of dust and cat hair that I apparently was not getting on my own.  The only people that I would advise not to get it are people who want something to get every single speck of dust every single time.  I knocked one star off since I will still have to use my upright vacuum on occasion and because of the extra ""Roomba-proofing"" that I am going to need to do because of my bookshelves."
6/29/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba is a Game-Changer,"The Roomba650 has absolutely changed my life.My main floor is roughly 1500ft with a pretty open floor plan:  Bamboo Wood Floors (they're very light in color, so the dog hair was always visible and I hated it) and 3 area rugs. 2 dogs (both adult black labs) and 2 adults.My favorite thing about this vacuum is that I don't have the vacuum.  My second favorite thing is that it vacuums while we're at work.  I set it to run every day of the week at 2:00pm and when I come home, I empty what it has picked up during the day (30 seconds).  I clean the sweepers and bearings every 3 days.  It usually takes about 3-5 minutes.I thought I'd answer a few of the questions I had when I was reading reviews.1: The Roomba is about 1/4 as loud as our Dyson.  I once tried to watch an episode of Law&Order while it was running and I could totally still hear Tutuola and Benson by increasing the volume by 2. It's less loud than someone using a blender in the same room as you.2: My baseboards have never been so clean. It's true that it gets hair and debris off of the baseboards.3: As a result of the Roomba's hatred of cords, my house has gotten cleaner because I made sure to tidy all cords and remove clutter.  I saw this as a ""con"" on several people's lists.  Wait... so you're complaining because a vacuum forced you to keep your house cleaner?  You whine too much. Also, you don't understand what vacuums are for.4: The Roomba easily moves over thresholds between doorways and over our rugs.  We don't have tasseled rugs, so I can't attest to how it would handle those, but I did leave a quilt that I've been working on out on the living room floor last week, and the Roomba very sweetly vacuumed it for me without destroying any of it (thank god).5: It's unreasonable for you to think that the Roomba will pick up every single hair or piece of dirt every single time.  It's a robot, not a maid service.  If you see something the Roomba missed one day, trust me it'll get it the next.6: Once in a while (about once every 3 weeks) The Roomba will get trapped in my bathroom and I'll find it there when I get home. (To be fair, that bathroom is tiny, covered in floor mats and it's the farthest point from the docking station.  I didn't follow the rules on where to put the docking station.) If all I have to do to vacuum the house is move a 5-pound, 1-foot wide disc back to a docking base, I'd buy this thing all over again!  (also to be noted, I've never used the room barriers, and this has still only happened a handful of times.)7: You need to vacuum your house before you turn on the Roomba the first time.  You cant expect it to pick up all the junk that has been collecting since the last time you vacuumed.8: The bin seems small because you probably vacuum every 3 days(if you're cuckoo or have kids) or once a week.  But when something is vacuuming every day, the amount of debris is substantially less.9: I'm cuckoo, so I still Dyson the rugs every week or two because Roomba is AMAZING but it's no Dyson on the rugs. Roomba has cut the amount of time I spend vacuuming the house from 2 hours a week to 20 minutes a week.  It practically takes me longer to get the Dyson out than it does to use it.I've had the Roomba650 for 6 months and as of this moment I have no complaints other than that it can't have babies.  It's important to have a little perspective.  Too many people review this vacuum like it was supposed to be a butler.  Yes, it'll get confused by your chairs being close together, yes it'll get stuck on cords... but so will a regular vacuum.  It's not sentient.Science is AMAZING. Get one! It totally changed my life.  100% worth it."

Often you have to supervise over it to make sure it gets everything. It may sound like a cool purchase but its overly expensive and a let down. Its not worth 400 dollars.
3/28/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great Product,"The Roomba lives up to the other 5 star reviews I read before purchasing this product. It's great, does just what they say it will do. I will never buy another kind of vacuum cleaner."

1/6/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,Works well on dirt - not so well on long pet hair,"The Roomba 650 worked well in picking up dirt from the hardwood and the carpet in the house.  It went around the furniture fairly well too. For pet hair it did not work as well.  If you have short haired pets it would probably work well, however, I have several large, long haired dogs and while it captured some of hair, it blew alot of the hair around the room.  The dust caontainer is small and it filled iwth the hair it did capture really quickly.  I emptied it constantly and it could not clean more than two rooms without being overwhelmed."

10/12/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Fur pickup,"The Roomba 650 does a nice job getting up over area rugs and picks up quite a bit of fur and cat litter.  It's a bit noisy, but not so bothersome that you couldn't listen to TV in the same room without turning up the volume.  It did get stuck at the stairway after going a bit too far over the edge, so I don't think I'd want it to run while I wasn't home."
1/3/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba is great,"The roomba ( we've named her Hazel) is a great device. It is set to clean every other day, picking up dog hair and dust throughout our home. Vacuuming is now reserved for furniture and stairs. My house stays so much cleaner and with less work!"
6/9/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great for cat owners!!,"The robot picks up TONS of cat hair and vacuums under the bed. I also like that it vacuums the area rugs. My regular vacuum would never do that and so I would have to try to shake the cat hair out outdoors. This robot vacuums them and they look like new. I use this on tile floor, carpet and area rugs. Judging by the amount of pet hair I clean out of the compartment, it picks up a lot more than the regular vacuum. LOVE it."

8/15/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,"Worse, once it has voided such unfortunate starfarers by ...","The primary problem with the iRobot Roomba 650 Vacuum Cleaning Robot was choice by IRobot to employ the Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer 9000 operating system for a machine with really quite baseline processing requirements. This unfortunate choice not only drives up the price of the vacuuming automaton, but also renders it apt to methodically murder the astronauts unfortunate enough to be paired with it on long intrastellar voyages. Worse, once it has voided such unfortunate starfarers by exposing the crew compartment to raw vacuum, the primary purpose of the Roomba is obviated: its suction chambers annoyingly cannot function in deep space and the acoustic sensor is rendered useless, as no one can hear beeps or screams in space. D+ (the color scheme is nice)."
12/14/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER,"THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER! WE have our roomba set up downstairs on our hardwood floors, it runs every day and does a spectacular job, so noticeable. very through in its cleaning. it hits all of the nooks and crannies! I highly recommend it, as we own one dog and three cats. no more fur, debris on the floor!  My only piece of advice.. schedule it to run it when you're not home, not like its very loud, but... its nice when it shuts off."
8/27/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Misrepresented -- not automatic -- see comprehensive details below,"The manufacturer's description of the Roomba wildly misrepresents its capabilities. If you are looking for a product that will clean your house twice weekly and require no intervention, there is no such product.The Roomba only suffices as a semi-automated cleaner if the cleaning space is small and well-contained. It will not, for example, navigate its way well through a multi-bedroom house without intervention.The intended use of the Roomba is for you to decide which room you want to clean; to place the Roomba in that room; and then to push the clean button. It will beep when it is done, at which time you are meant to empty its bin.As an afterthought the manufacturer added the scheduling feature -- however if you do not monitor it, you will find the bin filling up, or the Roomba leaving out certain rooms almost completely.The Roomba does not follow a very intelligent cleaning pattern. It relies on randomly turning until it has covered the area sufficiently many times. This is usually way more times than is needed to clean. There are time lapse photos on the Internet of the Roomba's cleaning path. Do search. Mathematically, the cleaning pattern will do a pretty good job for simple areas, but most people have furniture arranged with little space for the Roomba to find it's way around. It was never designed to cope with that situation even though it's extremely common. Hence my 1 star review.There is no way to update or improve the cleaning algorithm.This Roomba is useful for a one or two room area not larger than 500 square feet so that it can clean both rooms entirely in a reasonable time (before the 2 hour battery limit) and also not have it's bin fill up.It is extremely sad that this product works so badly because it would be so easy to improve the cleaning pattern using software changes alone. Unfortunately the software is not upgradable or configurable.There are many positive reviews of the Roomba. They are all correct in the sense that, given certain limited expectations, the Roomba works quite well. However those are not the expectations set by the manufacturers advertising -Which is a lie."

Also the black bumpers leave small black marks on my white baseboards. I find it easier to just get out the old vacuum.
12/3/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Not worth the money.,"The iRobot Roomba 650 vacuum is a cheap product. First of all, you will have to do more work than if you didn't have to use this vacuum because the vacuum gets full fast and the wheel gets stuck with pet hair every single day. The first day was the only time this robot worked, after that it was became louder and had to be maintained daily. It's just easier to vacuum with a regular upright vacuum. Also, after about 4 months of use the wheel became loose and the little rotating brush broke off. Now I have the iRobot sitting in the garage in a box. Save yourself some money and don't buy this. The idea was good but you end up spending more time trying to clean and maintain this little machine and you'll probably get less than a year of service before it starts breaking apart."
11/15/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Does a surprisingly good job,"The iRobot Roomba 650 is designed to vacuum dirt, dust, and other debris.  It easily picks up hair and pet fur.  In addition to the vacuum it has a side brush that cleans along the wall edges and corners and two counter rotating brushes that pickup dirt, dust, debris, and pet hair off the floor.  The Roomba works on carpet, hardwood floors, tile, and linoleum.  The virtual wall let you decide what rooms you want the Roomba to vacuum and what rooms you want left alone.  You can schedule the Roomba to clean at a time that is convenient for you - you can even have it vacuum while you aren't home!  It cleans under beds, around furniture, and avoids getting stuck on cords. It automatically recharges itself between cleanings.While I have the iRobot Roomba 780 and I am quite pleased with it, I was curious to see how the iRobot Roomba 650 works since it is labeled specifically for pets.  I have two cats and their fur seems to be everywhere.  I set the Roomba up in my bedroom because the cats like to sleep there - one cat in particular likes to sleep under my bed which is a major reason I wanted a Roomba because my vacuum won't reach under the bed.  I was a little apprehensive at first because the bin is a bit small and awkwardly shaped and I was wondering how much it could hold.  I was pleasantly surprised - it picked up a lot of debris and holds quite a bit before it needs to be emptied.  It does a great job of cleaning the area I want and the virtual wall keeps the Roomba exactly where I want it.  The only problem I had was that I didn't snap in the brushes correctly after I cleaned them when using the Roomba the first time and the Roomba kept starting and stopping. However, it was an easy problem to fix and purely human error.I find that the iRobot Roomba 650, while not as sleek looking as the iRobot Roomba 780, works just as well and it is now a permanent fixture in my bedroom where it does an excellent job of picking up and other debris.The iRobot Roomba 650 comes with the Roomba itself, home base, aerovac bin, one virtual wall, and an extra aerovac filter."
8/5/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Vanquishes all the dust bunnies hiding under the bed!,"The iRobot Roomba 650 does an amazing job with cleaning all the floors in my house. I set it loose the first day and off it went. It spent a lot of time under the beds, where it vanquished all the dust bunnies that had taken up residence and I'm sure thought they were safe! I feel like the entire house is also not as dusty now that the Roomba is vacuuming the floors every day.  And I like how at the end of its ""shift"", it returns itself to the base station to recharge for the next time."
11/6/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing!!!,The iRobot is amazing and easy to use. I love it. It is a great product. Recommended. The product also arrived in time. Great sellers too.
3/9/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,"Works well, with many limitations","The idea is clever. But it does not go into dark rugs (in our case, making it useless, since we bought it for those rugs specifically), gets stuck under sofas, and the cleaning pattern (the manufacturer's claims notwithstanding) is erratic, and it leaves many areas of any given room without a pass. If you live in a basketball court, or a ballroom (i.e. an empty space) this is the product for you. If not, be aware that it has limitations."
3/20/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Cleans Better than my Wife,"The headline says it all. We have all wood and tile floors, so the Roomba is a perfect vacuum cleaner for us. In addition, we have two dogs and the Roomba has no problems keeping up with the dog hair. This is a fabulous convenience.

2/4/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,It seems to clean ramdomly,"The advertise says the robot maps the rooms and learns its geography. Instead I observed that the robot passes over the same spot several times and does not cover some others. It returns to the dock only if the dock is near when it decides the work has been finished. I was expecting  something more intelligent, since cleaning the same spot several times is a waste o battery. That's the reason I've got desappointed. Other point is that the robot doesn't have a USB interface or something like that, so it will be impossible to upgrade de software in the feature, that means never I will have a intelligent algorithm to map the rooms!"
2/6/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Amazing,"That's the one word that I would use to describe this.  I don't have to vacuum again. It's not that I don't like to vacuum, I just can't find the time. I work full time, and I have a farm, and between the two, I couldn't find the time. When there is something that needs done on the farm(which is always), the house cleaning always gets pushed to the back. So the only time it gets done, is when it's so bad I can't stand it. So this way, I can set the Roomba on a schedule to clean, and it does the job.  A good job it does too. I am just so impressed with how it works. It cleans good, picks up the dog hair, hay, mud and whatever else we may drag in. It does really well around my dining room table and chairs.  I watched it get tangled up in some shoe strings, and then get itself untangled. It also got stuck on a hammer laying in the floor, and again it unstuck itself.  I can't say enough about the cleaning it does.  I wasn't expecting it to do as well as it does.  I love it, and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't like to or have the time to vacuum."
3/11/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Read up before you commit to make sure Roomba is right for you.,"That sounds trite, but it's true. And because I could talk about this for days and days, I won't. However, after weeks of research and reading, the best article (and product comparison) BY FAR is here: http://thesweethome.com/reviews/the-best-robot-vacuum-is-the-roomba-650/. We have a similar home set-up (primarily hardwood floors with area rugs), and lifestyle, and the Roomba is a perfect fit. It is NOT, as the article states, meant to replace your stand-up vacuum. But we now use the stand-up once a month as opposed to once a week thanks to the Roomba. Have a home with multiple floors? The Roomba has a handle that you can use to pick it up and physically move it yourself. Magic! You've solved that problem. Sometimes the Roomba has even more of a mind of its own (we press the ""Dock"" button and the Roomba might happily zoom around for another hour before docking), but overall it's amazing. The cats don't care about it (one day, they shall ride!), and the kids love it (we're like the Jetsons now).  And spot cleaning isn't something I have to lug the stand-up vac out of the closet for anymore."

2/19/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,The good news is that it seems to do a pretty ...,"Takes a couple of weeks to find all of the things in your house that might not play well with the Roomba (electronic cords on the ground or anything else that could get caught up in the brushes, lighter/wobbly things that the Roomba might push around or knock over, etc). The good news is that it seems to do a pretty quick job of recognizing when it's tangled and stops before doing any damage to the item or itself. And once you account for those things (get them up off the floor or hide them behind the invisible wall) the Roomba works great. We have dogs and having this run 5 times a week has knocked down the amount of visible dog hair to just about nothing. It's pretty nimble too - I navigates through our table and chair set just fine even though the chair legs are just barely wider than the Roomba itself. Basically the only places it doesn't get to are those where it can't fit under something (we have couches that sit really low to the floor, entertainment center, etc).It's pretty quiet for a vacuum but still loud enough to be distracting. Luckily it lets you set it to run on a schedule so we just have it run during the week while we're at work."
12/6/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great product. It works.,"Surprisingly thorough and meticulous coverage of space.NYC apartment - approx 1,100 sq ft.

And then finds its way back to the docking station.Quiet function.Here's what it will vacuum:- dust bunnies- mild dirt/debris- pet/cat hair- under the bed- under most couches- under tables- under places you may lazily avoid with a standard vacuumWhat it is NOT:  a heavy duty shop vac.  It will not replace your Dyson super-vac.Also it will not drive over ledges more than 0.5 to 1 inch high.It will though, programmable to run any day(s) of the week, provide daily maintenance and keep your house looking clean and refreshed.  I am surprised how much it does pick up, even on a seemingly clean looking hardwood floor.Also if your space is cluttered, tight, with lot's of ""stuff"" all over the floor, the Roomba will have a difficult time navigating efficiently through the diversions.All around, very satisfied and glad to have had made the investment."

11/4/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,"Very good overall at cleaning, when it works and does not stop on dark carpets","Summary: Very good at cleaning overall, when it works and does not stop on dark carpets!  The competitor Neato Botvac fits my need more than the Roomba overall, although still not perfect. I also cannot speak to durability/reliability yet since I have only had it a few weeks and just sent it back. More details below:Improvements needed:IMPROVEMENT 1.  Cant go over dark rugs - this was the biggest for me and why I could not keep the Roomba, what good is a vacuum that stops on dark rugs? Yes, it would just stop, sometimes avoid, but eventually just stop since it would try and hit the same area again, dumb thing.  I use schedule mode hoping to clean while gone, have a lot of dark colors and strips in my multiple contemporary area rugs in my home, and I would need 4-6 virtual walls to make it avoid my rugs, or buy new rugs which is silly. instead, I let it go everyday and it was a gamble on whether it would stop or not. I called customer service, not willing to provide much of any help and they apparently know of this issue, I asked why this was not disclosed and they stated it is not a limitation with the machine to perform, it is safety feature (to keep it from going downstairs) just something that the consumer must consider only if and when the problem arises with this feature. OK so I do not have stairs, why not disclose the possibility it mistakes dark rugs for stairs especially if it is quite high in this situation? Just like the drug commercials about potential side effects? There is no mention in the manual or on their website or a workaround.  If I would have known, then I would not have tried it. If it is valid and common complaint, why not have a button to override?  Or better yet, FIX IT!  It has been a problem in numerous models for many years now, I saw a Youtube regarding it dating back to 2007 when flip phones were in style!  Also, I do not have stairs, what safety factor am I risking? Also, even though IRobot Roomba does not advocate it, I tried the hack/fix by deactivating sensor putting foil, glossy white photo paper and reflective tape on the underside sensors. Tried very many times and could not get it to work. I would get the error repeatedly ""move Roomba to a new location and press clean"". Not sure how all the consumers out there got it working? Is there different firmware/software in the newest shipments? Is my foil not shiny enough? Doesn't matter, I don't accept putting duct tape on a machine I paid hundreds for anyway, it is the manufacturers issue to resolve, not the consumer.IMPROVEMENT 2. Dumb proximity sensors- it tends to be rough knocking into items such as chair legs, vases, anything that is basically not a wall or similar to a wall.  Note that Roomba appears to start its program in a spiral and then employ an algorithm to create unique trajectory to bounce around in a star pattern (from birds eye view) with minor changes every time it hits an obstacle to ensure it does not keep covering the same exact area. There are sensors that sense the wall and will slow the Roomba down, make it move along side it or around certain items but not before bumping or slamming into them. This may be effective overall in cleaning an area eventually, but it is dumb technology in terms of versatility and innovation. Each time you press the ""clean"" button on a Roomba, you do not know what you are going to get or where it will go.  Each time it finishes a session, it starts back over again and the random number generator sends it in a certain direction.  Neato has an excellent system for sensing and navigating the floor plan and prevents bumping into objects harshly.IMPROVEMENT 3.  Needs to be More Efficient Both in Power & Movement/Pattern- Its onboard sensory detection / navigation is poor in sensing areas it needs to get to and is capable of getting to.  It seems to get itself into places and knock and bump around a lot, then later it will go there again. I have seen it pass through some areas 3+ times in a session, twice is reasonable, but 3-4 times is just a waste of the devices time and puts more wear and tear on it (battery and mechanisms) and my furniture for no additional benefit.  Also speaking in terms of battery life, it appears to run about an hour new, which is not long enough for a larger home since it passes over the same areas multiple times and misses others.  I also understand this could be run multiple times in a day but not knowing what it has and hasn't cleaned does not help much besides ""hoping"" it got everything while I was gone.  I do not want this thing running so often over and over.  If nothing else, it should run for longer to further ensure it got more of the floor, but it is still a waste of energy, No human would cut their grass or vacuum the house in this manner, this is why it is not artificial intelligence (which is supposed to replicate human nature), it is just a combination of applied physics and dumb luck that things get cleaned.Here are the PROs Compared to Neato Botvac:PRO 1. Drive system is very good, never gets stuck (except for the dark colored rugs due to cliff sensor problems).PRO 2.  Dock size and Docking feature is really great.  Set the Roomba in the vicinity of the Dock, Hit the button and it docks itself.  The NEATO Botvac requires you to set it into the dock.  The Roomba I could store under a dining room buffet and keep it out of site. The Botvac charger is too tall and bulky to fit under it, even if it could I would have to reach down under it to push it into place.PRO 3.  The randomly going over the same spot on floors numerous times in a single session which will likely (although somewhat randomly) pick up more in a given area than Botvac which only passes over each spot 1 time.  This makes it more effective in overall cleaning if you run it all the time and I have to give it that much, although not too efficiently since the battery is constantly charging and discharging.Lastly in terms of cost and models and if you should choose - If you do not have dark carpets, it is worth trying a Roomba. Also note the Roomba is slightly more noisy, but that was not an issue for me since I basically ran it while away.  Although I like the Botvac 80, the Botvac 80 (less the ""D"") and Roomba 650 are about the same price right now. I could not find a difference between the 650 Roomba device and the 630 & 770 in terms of main cleaning device  The 630 does not have schedule feature and the 770 adds a HEPA filters, yet there is a big difference in the price. The 880 / 980 double the price.  In all honesty, the 650 is probably the best bang for your buck in the Roomba line and the performance of the next models up will most likely not be more than a 10% improvement in cleaning/convenience but for double the price which really does not make sense.  To target  well informed consumers, I think they need to rethink their pricing strategy, this is not an Apple device.."

1/28/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Four Stars,Still learning to use it.
8/22/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Brief Review,Still being evaluated. But a simple wireless link for established functions would be a great improvement.More later.
8/4/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Buy it!,"So worth its money! My hardwood & carpet floors look like new. Love the programmable function, I run it every morning to keep up with 2 shedding dogs."
9/15/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Day one, thumbs up :)","So this will be long but worth it. I plan to update this as time goes on. This is our first day with Roomba. I let it charge fully as the quick start guide said to. Once I got the green light with the OK, I sent rumba out into the wild. I did not use any of the blocking sensors for the first time. I wanted to see just what roomba could do. So after stalking it all over my house, I have to say it will never be as good as me, after all I am woman I am the best. But I will say it will definitely make my work week easier. I have 3 cats a golden retriever and a Maltese. That is a lot of hair. I did not vacuum prior to letting it do its job tonight because I wanted to see just what it was capable of handling. After it had run its course it did return to its docking station which I have to say was pretty entertaining to watch. Since I have done like everyone else and read a million and one reviews and watched a million and one videos I have decided I will use the schedule but it will be run while I am home just in case of a fire hazard, as the wife of a fireman this is very important to me. Overall I will say just like everyone else has stated this will not replace vacuuming all together but if you were like me and  vacuum  multiple times a week and do your floors on your hands and knees every weekend this will make it to where you can spend more time doing what you need to do at home with your family instead of vacuuming every other day. On another note I did follow the recommendation of another reviewer and place a piece of electrical tape on the plastic rolling wheel to protect my hardwood floors from scratches after watching it go around tonight I will also be buying small circular felt pads to place around the bumper system just to keep any additional scratching and damage to my floor boards at a minimum."
10/2/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,YEAH!!!,"So I've only used it twice, but let me tell you that I LOVE it. Two days prior to receiving this in the mail my home was professionally cleaned. I decided to run the roomba despite this just to see if it would find anything else to pick up. Well let me tell you! After running it downstairs i went to check on the trash canister and it was completely full!!! I couldn't believe it! It's able to get under sofas and other low lying furniture so I suppose that's where it picked up most of its contents. But I was really impressed! I then ran it upstairs and had the same experience. I think me and this roomba are going to live very happily together. They say money can't buy you happiness, but to that I say you must not have a roomba in your life."
1/31/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,If you hate sweeping for hours and/or hate stepping on pet debris,"So i was not sure how well this would work... if you have pets, you need this device.  Should have bought sooner.  In the last week alone, every day this thing picked up an absurd amount of hair and dirt from our laminate floors - which we thought were rather clean.  If you hate sweeping for hours and/or hate stepping on pet debris, this is your solution...  Automation where it makes sense...Only gripe is that it does not have an app, so I can't watch it run around the house terrorizing my cats unless i come home and physically turn it on."
1/28/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Finally control over dog hair!,"So I actually didn't purchase my Roomba 650 on Amazon, but I used Amazon for the reviews prior to purchasing so I figured I should give my input here to help out someone on the fence like I was. We purchased it through Bed Bath and Beyond with a 20% off coupon which saved us about $60. I have wanted a Roomba ever since rescuing my German Sheppard/lab mix. While she is a beautiful dog, she sheds like no other dog I have ever seen. In a given week, I have to deep vacuum my entire house at least 2 times in order to have control over the hair. If I happen to go a week (god forbid!) everything is covered in dog hair and you literally have to jump over tumble weeds of dog hair. It drives me crazy and is so embarrassing. So this past weekend, I purchased this product. We have used it the last 4 days and I already see such a huge difference!! It has been five days since we actually used our vacuum and the hair is barely noticeable!! Not a single tumble weed of dog hair anywhere. On top of that, the Roomba is able to get under our bed and dressers- places I am rarely able to get to without major difficulty. We bought it on a trial basis thinking that we would probably end up returning it because it wouldn't be able to keep up with the dog hair. But I have to say, we will never return this. I was also worried that it wouldn't be able to do the job like one of the higher priced models. Now I have never used any other one so I can't say they wouldn't do just as good or even a better job. But this one is perfect for us. It was better priced and does an amazing job. I can't even begin to tell you how happy I am when I leave for work in the morning and I hear this Roomba vacuuming around my living room sucking up all that dog hair! I am completely satisfied and I am sorry I waited so long to buy one."
8/7/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,So happy that we have a Roomba in our house again,"So happy that we have a Roomba in our house again!  We had series 1 many years ago and were somewhat pleased with it.  We've got this one running constantly and it is doing a great job.  So far, he finds his home dock every time.  He does not get tangled up in wires-believe me ,we have plenty and the animal kingdom residing in our home (2 cats, 2 dogs and 1 bird) all find him mildly amusing.  My 18 month old grandson was mildly startled the first time he turned him on and he came out of his docking station-but got over it quickly."
12/7/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love!,"So far, I love this product."
1/20/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Second time around is better!  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.,"So far, 4 1/2 stars.I purchased the 650 2+ years ago and didn't like it at the time.  It missed a lot of areas, etc. and I just wasn't impressed.  I returned that one.Fast forward to now.  We have a different dog who sheds like no other.  Pair that with everyday tracking in of dirt, and I have been desperate to not have to vacuum every single day.  I decided to give the Roomba another try.  So far, I am glad that I did.I don't know if my first Roomba was a bad one, or if these have improved over the last 2 years (same model both times).  However, this time the vacuum goes everywhere and does an excellent job of cleaning!  It even goes into one room off the hall that had been completely ignored by the first Roomba.  This one also does not slam into things like the previous one did.The amount of dog hair it picks up is impressive.  The dust amount is even crazier.  It's picking up much more dust than my hard floor vacuum (our house is mostly hard flooring).  It transitions onto our area rug from the tile without a hitch.Here's my only downside so far:I really wanted to run this overnight so we'd wake up to clean floors.  In addition, our dog would be in his room and away from the Roomba (he is not a fan).  However, this thing lurches over our 1 ft. tiles like a zombie.  Every time the front caster wheel hits a grout joint, it thuds.  It was enough to wake me at 2:15 a.m.We've decided to just run it before bedtime and give the dog a safe haven elsewhere."
12/7/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Overall, satisfied.","So far we like the Roomba.  It does have a few ""glitches.""  For some reason, it get stuck on the area rug in our dining room.  It gives the ""move to another location and restart"" error.  I'm not sure why it does this, but it isn't a deal breaker.  On the hard wood floors and the tile floors it does a surprisingly good job.  Watch out for cords.  It will choke on phone cords if it gets hold of one."
4/23/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,2 months of daily use and still love it,"So far we have used our Roomba 650 for 2 months and it is working great.  We purchased this at BB&B with a coupon (which is why I'm not a verified purchaser).  With its programmable mode it has been run at least daily every day for the last two months.  I'll try to touch upon all the common pro's and con's that are mentioned most frequently.My pro's- Noise....is it whisper quiet, no.  But it is significantly quiter than a standard upright vaccuum.  You can have it running in the same room or next room and have the TV on or have a conversation without having to have the volume at max or screaming at another person.- Coverage....it is great in that it can get under couches, beds, tables, and around chairs.  If you leave the coverage to more than a room, it may pick up 80-90% of the dirt.  If you run it again in the same room the next time, it will be completely cleaned up.  If you leave the roomba to only one room you shouldn't see any left over dirt.  You will see a significant amount of dirt cleaned up with each running.- Automation...the ease of scheduling the roomba to run at any time of the day is virtually fool proof.  We have our set to run at 1am every night.  With the bedroom upstairs and the roomba running downstairs we don't hear a thing.  Also if you place the charging home base receiver in a good place it returns at the end of the cleaning back to its charging base.- Multiple surfaces...The roomba does a great job with carpets, hardwood floor, or tiles.  It has no problem with moving from a hardwood floor to a carpeted area.My Con's- Accessories...if you are trying to do more than one room at a time you will likely have to buy some additional acceessories such as a virtual wall or halo.  But if you have a fairly closed floor plan/apartment the single virtual wall that comes with the 650 should be good enough- Sensors...Overall the sensors work great, but the msot noise that you hear is the roomba running into narrow leg/table chairs.  The roomba has a soft touch for walls/hanging fabric from bed or couches.  But if the furniture has a narrow leg (I think I read it has to be 3 inches wide for the sensor to see a leg) it will bump into the leg a normal speed.  With table and chair legs this is where you can get the most noise with it eventually escaping the legs.  Also if the home base is hidden in a corner or next to a large item it may not always find the home base, we occasionally find it in the middle of the floor because it couldn't find the home base.- ""Frequent"" cleaning....After your first use in any room you will have to empty the bin as it will be getting to areas that you don't normally clean.  The bin is relatively small so you will have to empty the bin every 2-3 days, and clean the brushes about once a week.  This is a change for people who are not used to doing this with their standard vaccuum's. Although this is all easy to do it is just something that you have to remember to do.Overall we love our roomba and would get another one if this breaks."
5/1/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Impressed this sceptic,So far this little guy is wonderful.  I've only had it a day.  I've set it to clean twice and was impressed.  No this will not replace you cleaning the right way.  It is not perfect in the corners.  I'm still trying to figure out what it's cleaning pattern was in the bathroom.  But was very impressed in it cleaning hard floors and area rugs.  I will update this review after using it a few months.
5/29/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Not amazing but major time saver,"So far so good. It's been a month. The Roomba does a mediocre job at vacuuming, but since it means that I don't need to vacuum but I get the benefit of mostly clean floors and carpets, I win."
5/29/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,So far so good. Although it finds a step and stops,"So far so good.  Although it finds a step and stops, it simply stops and says there's an error.  You have to go move it and set it to go again.  It's not a huge problem, and as long as remember to use the virtual wall that came with it it's fine.  Works well both on hardwoods and carpet."

6/18/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Time Saver!,Saves a lot of time and really makes our life at home easier!
5/1/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Works great!,Saved me so much time! I have all hardwood floors and 2 doxies that shed a lot. I have this thing go on every other day while I am at work. Get home and empty it out. It fills up real good and does the job!
12/17/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I named her Samantha,"Samantha was a hard broad to understand at first but later on she became an open book. Literally. A manual comes with the robot that would tell you everything to know about her.  She had some difficulty at first negotiating all the obstacles in my one bed room apartment that has a lot of furniture ;  so for a week or so , she lost her way back to the dock and ran out of charge midway. Though she did clean every step of the way , it was evident from the clean trails that she was lost. Poor thing.After a week, Samantha found her way back to the dock so no more sleeping off out of charge inside the cupboard , under the bed, chewing toilet paper and garbage. Moving furniture still confuses her like an 90 year old on dementia so give her some time and she will be the house maid you always wanted."
1/12/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great product if you have pets,"Run this sucker a few times a week and you can say goodbye, at least temporarily to pet hair.  Does a nice job of navigating around furniture, but it works better if you take a few minutes to remove things it can get caught under such as kitchen chairs.  It also helps to block off one room at a time to let if focus on cleaning smaller areas.  Our rooms are fairly large and we have an open layout, so this is necessary.  I usually just use the chairs or a few couch pillows to restrict the area and all's well. Does a great job of negotiating around furniture, walls, etc., but can get hung up if you have a bunch of tight spaces.It's amazing how much stuff this thing picks up and how long it operates on one battery - about 45 minutes.  Negotiates hardwood and carpet well, but struggles to get over one rug that has a thicker pad than the others.This thing is cool.  Our dogs like it and so do we."
11/5/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,One Star,ruined my wood floors!
3/4/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Do your family a favor and buy a Roomba!,"Roombas work well and demonstrate a well executed intelligent and thoughtful design process with appropriate materials choices. Battery life is excellent - Roomba does a lot of work between charges. Results are better than if you or a cleaning service worked on your floors will dust mops, brooms and vacuum cleaners. Lots of bang for your bucks.Important note - unless you have a really strong inner Nerd or live in a museum I suggest you ignore custom programing options and just set it down, push the start button and let Roomba do its thing. You and your family will be happier if you do.Routine maintenance is simple and requires very little in the way of tools (We are on year four of Roomba ownership and have been able to perform maintenance and module replacement with #1 and #2 Philips screwdrivers and a small set of precision screwdrivers).  The folks at iRobot are a shinning example of the best in product engineering. I am notorious for nit-picking product design and can't find anything about Roomba or iRobot that needs to change. Replacement modules and parts are modestly priced. Brief aside - several ears ago iRobot improved the design of their brush module and it was a real improvement (as opposed to a gratuitous move to charge an inflated price for not much of an improvement)! There was no extra charge for the improved module. The improved module was incorporated in all production going forward.My wife and I both work full time jobs and used to spend most of Saturday cleaning house. Our Roombas do a much better job of cleaning our floors than we can using dust mops, brooms and vacuum cleaners. Roombas work great on carpeted and hard floor surfaces. Prior to replacing the carpet in our bedroom with hardwood flooring we ran the Roomba through three complete battery charges and it was STILL picking up lots of cat hair that our conventional vacuum cleaner (a Windsor XL - a really good vac) left behind."
9/21/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Great vacuum, reliable, excellent on hardwood floors and carpet","Roomba- to put into words the joys you've brought me! Besides being an amazing vacuum, the scheduling is one of my favorite parts. Since this Roomba is a bit noisy (I can still talk to people or hear the television), I prefer to schedule the Roomba while I am at work. I have 2 cats and have to keep their liter box downstairs on the main floor, and they have a tendency to track cat liter on my hard wood floors. Roomba solves that for me! I come home to a completely clean, no mess home.My suggestions:1. Pick up any stray cords off the floor- they can get twisted in Roomba's brushes and you'll find a stalled Roomba when you get home.2. Roomba does not like shag carpet, so you will have to keep your regular vacuum for any tall shag carpet.3. CLEAN YOUR BRUSHES! I clean mine weekly and purchased the replacement kit, and you can totally tell the difference between dirty, tangled brushes and clean or new brushes.4. Try to make the path as open as possible. Roomba is completely random in its route, so if you have less of a maze for Roomba to go through, it will spend less time bouncing around running into things, and more time cleaning."
10/9/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Roomba, roomba, roomBA!!","Roomba, roomba, roomBA!!We have a large house and we've had 7 of these robots over the last 13 years for different levels of the house - they all took a beating to be sure. One of my 8 year old's 1st words was roomba, and when we fly to Aruba she STILL to this day says ""we're going to aroomba!""Yes, they break down; yes, they need regular maintenance; yes they're expensive. But if you use it daily and clean it out, you will have a cleaner house with far less work."
10/1/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Will not vacuum dark colored surfaces!,"Roomba's used to work great. These new models ex: the 650 DO NOT vacuum dark colored rugs. I contacted customer support and they told me, ""the robot will not be able to clean the rug because of the color"".  Buyers beware. Don't waste your money."
9/23/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,"Roomba works great, however don't forget to clean out the bristles every week or so."
12/29/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great Vacuum with only a few minor set backs,"Roomba works great on our hardwood floors. I have to run this guy every other day to help the battle on pet hair and it does a fairly good job. I have had the roomba for almost a month now and it definitely gets smarter over time. At first it took a long time to find the docking station but it knows its ""home"" now. After it runs a cleaning cycle I may have to get a few corners it missed but all in all it helps me out by not having to sweep every day and waft the pet hair around.We also have a few rugs around the house and it nicely transitions from the hardwood to the rugs. We have shaggy carpet upstairs and I haven't tried it on that yet, I think it would be too long for it.The one con to the roomba is you really have to pick up your house before it starts. You have to make sure there are no cords in the way for other things for it to get stuck on. Also one time we ran the roomba and left the house and it knocked over a ladder shelf we have in the hallway. Thank God the damage was minimal because I had some nice glass votives on it. Some how it went under the bottom shelf, got stuck, and backed out and pulled the shelf out with it. So now we will not be running it when we are gone. Also the roomba is pretty loud. I know the directions say you can schedule a cleaning cycle to run at night but it bangs around on stuff in our house that I don't think I would be able to sleep."
1/30/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Should have gotten this sooner,Roomba works great on hard wood floors. Very easy to program. Easy to clean. Works good on carpet. I love that it cleans under the bed
4/3/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great lite vacuum,Roomba vac arrived on time.  It was well packaged.  It does a great job picking up most dirt and pet hair.  It takes much longer to complete the job compared to a conventional vac because it doesn't stay in 1 room to finish the job.  I just let it go for 1 hour while I'm doing something else.  That's what is nice is it frees you up to do other things.  There is a more expensive model that claims it stays in 1 room until it is done before going to another room but the cost was more than I wanted to invest.  I really love the Roomba.
10/27/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Love my Roomba,Roomba rocks for keeping the dirt manageable.

9/14/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba is one of my absolute favorite items of all time,"Roomba is one of my absolute favorite items of all time. As a cat owner I always have to stay on top of the cleaning. This really does pick up a lot of dirt and hair, and does a great job of the daily maintenance floor cleaning. I don't use the scheduling options because I prefer to run it when I'm around, but it is so easy to just step on the big center button to turn it on and let it go.It really does clean the whole floor and it does ""learn"" the area. It goes over my hard floors, carpet AND an area rug nicely. It does not replace regular vacuuming and sweeping, but for daily floor maintenance, this thing is a real time-saver. It travels well and could seemingly last forever."
1/22/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Your home is not truly clean until it is Roomba Clean!!,"Roomba is my new best friend!!!  I love Roomba. I was reluctant to get a Roomba because I really didn't trust that it would be able to clean my floors as well as I do, I am neat freak.  However, I have to say that this is the most amazing gadget that I have every owned.  I love it so much and rave about it to all my friends that I now feel that I should be the new spokes woman/sales woman for Roomba because 8 of my friends now own one because of my recommendations.  I even loaned it to a very skeptical friend for the day.  She has a shedding dog and had just had her house professionally cleaned that day, I told her that I didn't think it was truly clean until it was Roomba clean.  She was ""floored"" by how much more dirt Roomba was able to pick up, no pun intended, Roomba managed to fill a whole cartridge of dirt and then I charged it and brought it back the same day and it filled up another cartridge. She was so impressed that she bought a Roomba and now only has her cleaning lady come every other week, and told her not to waste time on her floors, because Roomba's got it taken care of.My favorite thing about Roomba is that my floors are cleaned every day, which drastically reduces the dust in my home and I find myself dusting far less (from twice a week, now only once every other week), I also found that my intake filters need to be changed less often.  I only bring out my regular vacuum about once every 2 weeks, to areas that Roomba can not reach (behind the toilet, in cabinets, in small closets, on pantry shelves, etc.)Sometimes, I run Roomba twice in a day, for instance during the Christmas holiday, I would run Roomba before the party and then again after all the guest would leave.  Now, seriously, who likes to vacuum every day, or twice a day, NO ONE!  But for some reason, Roomba never complains, and even sings a sweet little song every time it's done for the day and returns to base.Roomba you are simply amazing!"
12/1/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba is cool,Roomba is great.It cleans great and it is so cool.Romba 650Is the best.When Romba is charged it has a green light.
10/14/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great technology used for home,"Roomba is great helper for home and the office, save me time and money.It works and covers more areas that I was thinking."
6/5/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,Roomba is back !!!
10/29/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,5 star machine with a 1/2 star life,"Roomba is a 5 star machine with a 1/2 star life. We just buried our 4th Roomba in 7 yrs :(  Two had charging errors, and the last two had broken gear issues so the rollers couldn't turn to collect the dirt/hair. You may ask why someone would be so foolish to continue spending so much money on something while expecting different results each time, and you're right. The thing is, when Roomba is alive and well, it is your best friend. We have 2 cats and 2 dogs, Pergo, and low pile natural fiber area rugs. I was amazed at how the bin would fill up every day. It makes you realize how dirty your home is if you don't sweep every day (like mine is now). I haven't read all of the top reviews, but I imagine that they wrote them a little too soon-right before theirs died.PROS:-Keeps your floors looking a lot cleaner than you probably would, which takes your house to a whole new clean level-Programmable-Runs for about 2 hours before returning to base-Even though it's a rip-off, $350/18mon= ~$20. It's like giving Roomba a monthly allowance while it does a better job than your kid AND it doesn't give you attitude.CONS:-Life span of about 18 months on average for the 4 we owned-Bumper does leave black marks on white baseboards (Magic Eraser takes off)-WAY overpriced for the life spanNOT NECESSARILY CONS BUT GOOD TO NOTE:-You still have to vacuum your rugs once a week. It cleans the surface, but doesn't use suction. It works kinda like that manual sweeper they use in restaurants.-The noise is tolerable (quieter than an upright vacuum), but I definitely can't sleep through it, talk on the phone, or watch tv in peace.-I scheduled mine for 11am so I had time to dust, clean off the kitchen counters, and pick up Roomba's favorite snacks (earbuds and panties) off the floor.-If you're getting this to keep the area under your bird cage clean, don't. I found it very inefficient with that.-It has a high profile like all robotic vacuums and doesn't get under some pieces of furniture. We stacked felt pads under a couple of furniture pieces and voila!-We had trouble with one of them not returning to base until we moved the base over a few inches to clear our kitchen island. It needs to be placed in a more open area and not around a 'corner'.-It does tend to do a better job in zones rather than just letting it loose in the whole house.-You do have to empty it after every use. We didn't mind that, since that's much quicker than sweeping the whole house, but it seems to annoy some others.-If you have a walk-in shower, it doesn't discriminate. We learned to close our bathroom door so it wouldn't go in the wet shower and make a mess.-If I ever buy another one (because I'm cra cra) it will be from Costco because of their awesome return policy. There seem to be several complaints in the reviews about the terrible customer service/warranty from the manufacturer."
5/6/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Fairly amazing piece of technology,"Roomba has gotten a lot better. This model operates pretty well, picks up most stuff from the carpet. The automatic timer is sweet, expect when your dog poops on the carpet when you're not home and then it goes and smears it all over your house and coats the innards of the Roomba. Careful about that."
2/19/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Exceeded Expectations,"Roomba has far outdone our expectations. We have hardwood, rugs, tile, and carpet in our house. Roomba manages to clean all surfaces quite well. With three indoor cats and a large dog, we get our fair share of pet hair on the floor. We run roomba most everyday, and it does a fantastic job. I would definitely recommend it."
8/23/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Roomba failed after 16 months of light use one level ...,"Roomba failed after 16 months of light use one level hardwood floor, 45 minutes-1 hour, one day a week, and iRobot will not stand behind the product what so ever. Thoroughly displeased, and would not purchase had I seen a similar review."
2/18/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love it,Roomba does exactly what it says it does. We have wood laminate floors and area rugs and every day at 9 roomba cleans both very well. We wet jet once a week roomba does the rest.
9/10/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Stopped working last night - plastic body deformed (likely due to extreme heat),"Rooba has been an unpleasant adventure for us.For the first month it couldn't navigate past dining table/chairs area on most nights. We made it a habit to put the chairs up on the table every night (like in restaurants) to aid the poor soul. It is hard work but it helped - it started to reliably navigated past the dining space. Then, it couldn't navigate the rug in the powder room under the washbasin :(. We started shutting the powder room door every night. Result! - it could then reliably navigate to the living room/drawing room area.We had a few weeks of good cleaning (pet hair and all) - yes it's really nice when it works.But this morning I found it dead in the kitchen - no response when I guided it to the base station (no charging lights). Then to my horror - I realized that a portion of the top plastic body had buckled in (yep!) - likely due to extreme heat. I'm glad it didn't cause a fire at 2am, but also sad that it went kaput just as I'd started to like it a little (I design software for a living - it's in my DNA to fall in love with autonomous machines trying so hard to be helpful, whereas all my lawyer wife can say is #*%!*)Now starts the fun process of calling the company and bickering about warrenty/repair/replacement. I'll let you know how that goes."
2/24/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,robot roomba review,romba did not pick up pet hair as advertised.  i was very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.
11/28/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Wonderful,Rollie is cleaning as I type this getting ready for thanksgiving company.  It is amazing to watch the little guy.  I have four dogs and he keeps the floor clean of dog hair.  I read the reviews on this product and most everyone considered their Roomba to be part of the family and they had names for them.  I see why.  This is an amazing product and I highly recommend it.
1/4/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Toy or appliance?,"Right now roomba is more of a fun toy than a valued appliance.  Did a great job on our hardwood floors though.  Does an OK job on the rug.  It does not appear to deep clean, only a surface clean on the rug.  Highly recommend following the instructions to clean the rollers and filter after each use."

1/18/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Roomba 650 Vacuum Falls Apart In 40 Days...,"Received this on 12-09-2014 - today is 01-18-2015.  I have one dog (Lab) and two long-hair house cats.  Obviously, I need help with the fur shedding issue.  I purchased this unit as a maintenance tool (in between Dyson Deep-clean vacuuming).  According to the description, this model is made to pick up animal fur.  It can be programmed and the wearable and replaceable parts are fairly inexpensive.  I programmed this unit to run everyday.  I clean the unit after each cleaning cycle - taking the brushes apart and removing fur buildup on any moving parts.  As of today, the top small circular cover is broken off - caught on the kick-plate area of our lower kitchen cupboards.  This happened the first day it was in use.  It will no longer hold the programming that was initially done. I have to manually start it each day - it has never completely lost power and has always gone back to it's dock when a cycle is complete.  After a little more than a month's daily use, it is half broken, the corner brushes are scratching my floorboards and it no longer completely vacuums the area it used to clean.  I am definitely not impressed with this appliance - especially for the price point paid ($349.99).  This is the same price I paid for my Dyson upright and although I have to manually push this appliance, at least it does what was promised.  I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS MACHINE."
1/4/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Required voltage.,"Received the items as purchased, found unreasonable to use it, totally waste of time and money..It might be my mistake but get no help from iRobot. Singapore using 220v and purchase iRobot came with 110v usage.Try to purchase replacement adaptor from their rep iRobot office in Singapore and they totally reject my telecall as I had purchase from oversea.Wrote to iRobot customer service, they unable to help. WHAT THE HELL, A REP OFFICE FOR?????Therefore purchase a convertor to step down the voltage, the convertor got blown, not working.Open the machine and check all precautions as instructed, found no defect, check battery all ok.Try brought another adaptor to lower voltage output, it manage to work with the docking machine, but battery unable to be charged. The iRobot kept prompting with either ""ERR 2 or ERR5"", changed to the replacement battery, still unable to charge.Now with this machine in the living room awaiting to be charged as both battery power run out.

First few days I was hoping it will get better as soon as it figures out the house layout but...It spent hours riding around and randomly cleaning the house here and there or could just clean a couple of sq feet and back to the station. So last week I took it back to the store. I do not feel like it worth the money, I can do the same kind of cleaning in 5 minutes with an electrical $15-20 broom."
6/22/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great product!,Really reduces the amount of time I need to spend on vacuuming.

6/23/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Good quality,"Quite happy with this unit so far. I read through some reviews online and was almost ready to buy a less recognized branded product, but came back to Roomba as the final decision. I have a 1 bedroom apartment with hard floors so it's compatible to my home environment. Not the panacea of dirt on the floor/rug but is a nice supplement to my other cleaning. Pretty impressed since I'd never owned a robotic vacuum before now."
3/4/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,How did we live without it,"Push a button and it cleans the floor, what more could you ask.  Well, how about one that dusts the furniture?  When iRobot makes it I will be first in line to buy it."

12/18/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Life Saver / Game Changer,"Purchased about a month ago and this has CHANGED MY LIFE. I have two dogs, and this keeps the hair under control during the week. ""Rosie"" as I have named my Roomba is scheduled to clean daily in the afternoon. She has attempted to eat a sneaker and shut herself in the bathroom once or twice, but nothing that would discourage me from using her. Roomba likes not too much clutter, and this inspires me to keep my home tidy. I live on in a 1 story single family home with tile, hardwood, and some area rugs. MY only regret is not buying this 8 year ago when I got my dog!"
1/3/16,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,I fell in love with it the first few weeks after buying it,"Pros:I fell in love with it the first few weeks after buying it... It did a great job of going under the beds, in closets, tables, stereo cabinet, etc... wherever it could fit... I began organizing the house so it would be able to reach more areas... I love that it goes over the thresholds, mats and rugs on my hardwood and tile floors... some are pretty high... I was impressed by this... I have to young boys so cleaning the floor constantly is a chore...Cons:Got it for Christmas so I was eager to try it out on a hard job...  I took the Christmas tree down and left the spruce needles on the hardwood floor... While it picked up some, it left a lot more than it picked up...  giving it the benefit of the doubt (heavy job and all) I helped it out by sweeping up some... I notice it goes over the same areas several times and completely misses other areas... When I leave it to roam the entire house, I find it stays in one area a lot more than others... I'll periodically move it to other areas so it can cover them.  It doesn't do so well in the corners so I will sweep them when its running...Overall 3.5 Stars... while it does a good job it doesn't do a great job...  my suggestion for improvement:  needs a stronger suction on it..."
12/19/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Really surprised,"Pros:Gets under beds, couches and places that upright will not get easily.You just hit the button and go do something else.  Or schedule it and are already doing something elseReduces the need for upright.  Though I could see me needing to break it out once a month and for stairs.Gets all the dog hair and that alone is worth its weight in gold.Easy to clean.  4 minutes tops.  Slower at first.  You'll get the hang of it. I use canned air to blow out the filter to extend its life.  Do that outside.Cons:Expect to clean it a lot at first.  It will go to places your vacuum hasn't seen and find some gross things.  Do you have dogs and when was the last time you looked under your bed?Little loud, Sounds like a loud pencil sharpener to me.  Not terrible but I wouldn't have a business call in the same room.  next room no problemPerceived randomness.  It will get everything but if you watch it work you'll really wonder. Just walk away and come backYou will need to roomba proof when you find it stuck here and there.  There will be furniture that will hang it up.Depending on your layout, May not always find way back to dock. Just experiment with placementOverall: Great device and picks up everything an upright would. I haven't tried the scheduling so I cannot comment on that. Id love another for the upstairs floor but at 400 bones it will be a while"
5/30/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Couldn't Handle Small Apartment,"Pros:- Does a good job cleaning (sometimes it ignores areas)- Found the home base more often then not (unless it got stuck)Cons:- Doesn't clean black carpet.  I knew this was a known problem when I purchased it and was able to cover the sensors like other have suggested.  But this only worked temporarily.- Got beat up pretty quickly. Scratches and marks started to show up only after a couple cleanings.- It's cleaning method is flawed. It appears to be just bouncing off walls.  Sometimes it cleaned all the areas I wanted other times it  would miss completely.-  It get's stuck on things a little to easily. To prevent it from getting stuck, I started to use random shoes to block it from getting stuck in certain areas.To sum it up, when it worked, it worked very well.  I wanted this mainly to clean hard to reach places like under my bed and my carpet. At the end of the day it ended up being more work helping the robot then just cleaning myself.  Showed promise but ended up returning it.  I have a small place.  I have no idea how this would handle a house with multiple rooms.If you want this to work on black carpets, don't waste your time. Roomba's have a sensor that detect when it senses stairs so it doesn't fall down.  The problem with this is when it see's black carpet it thinks it going to fall.  Until iRobot has a way to turn off that sensor, the entire iRobot product line is useless to black carpet users."
1/7/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Good purchase, albeit a bit pricey. Beat vacuum the whole house daily.","Pros: easy automatic effectiveCons: each run takes almost 1.5 hours, need to clean roomba after each use""It works as advertised. We were a bit skeptical at first since we have lots of furniture and three cats and a dog.First time we ran it, it took almost an hour and half to vacuum the whole house. It vacuumed the same place three to four times. I guess the Roomba isn't smart enough.Anyway, it managed to return to docking station. When we cleaned it, we were surprised to see how much dust it collected.We run the Roomba daily. Just make sure you clean the Roomba after each use. I don't mind cleaning the Roomba. It beats cleaning the whole house."""
3/25/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Great for Bunnies - Cliff Detection Lacking,"Pros: - This Roomba is great for cleaning up after bunnies. It gets any poops that don't make it into the litter box, and it even picks up the hay. The bunnies don't love the Roomba, but they tolerate it. - I love the scheduling feature. We have it set to clean every weekday at 4:30, so the house is clean when we get home. You can set different times for different days of the week. - A pleasant woman's voice actually tells you what's wrong instead of just displaying an error code or beeping. The female voice is a little confusing, since we named him Mr. Roomba, but we accept him/her for who he/she is. - The bin has a decent capacity and is easy to empty. - I'm impressed with the battery life. - If you press the docking button it'll make its way back to the charging base, as long as it's within a few feet of it.Cons - It has cliff detection, which means it doesn't fall down the stairs, but when it sees the stairs it just stops and asks you to rescue it. I wish it would back away from the stairs and continue cleaning. - We have a bar stool like this (http://smile.amazon.com/Winsome-Wood-Spectrum-Swivel-Adjustable/dp/B0046EC162), and the Roomba always gets stuck on the base. We end up keeping the bar stool shut away in the bathroom so the Roomba won't get stuck.Overall it's definitely worth the money."
4/12/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Wonderful for multi-pet owners,"Pros - Life altering purchase if you a frequent cleaner. I'd give it a 4.5 but that's not an option so I'll round up. I have 2 great danes that shed during the hot summer months in the south. I went from vacuuming or sweeping at least every other day to only having to do it about every 10 days. I've nicknamed him Ralphie and he works his rear end off. I have a very unique shape floorplan and Ralphie has learned it with no problems. I have a 3200 sq ft home and he can do the entire downstairs only having to be emptied after he's done. Ralphie does well on rugs, hardwood, and tile; I have no carpet so can not speak to it.Cons - They will get stuck under certain sizes of furniture but not often. Also, every 3rd use you need to clean the brush and rollers but this is not hard to do. I highly recommend you get a model that has more of the virtual walls with it as it will do a far superior job cleaning if you quadrant off certain rooms to only do those at a time. Also, they will catch cables that are under a couch so you have to tuck those in."
3/16/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Impressive gizmo, finds dirt I cannot see","PROIt finds dirt I cannot see. No matter how often I run it in a place I think is clean, it finds more.It starts on schedule, cleans my living room, dining room, and kitchen -- and parks itself again. It can go days without any attention at all.It's happy on floors, rugs, combinations, carpet, under furniture.It won't throw itself down stairs.Quick to unpack, charge and put to use.Easy to schedule.Results visible immediately.CONBumps into things it should really be able to 'see'. The sensor array needs improvement. It detects walls if headed mostly toward them and slows before impact, but mostly it bumps gently and reacts. Determining the edges of things consists mostly of turning and bumping. A higher resolution view of the world would allow much better routing and impact decisions.I have a golden retriever. Roomba gets all of it, but it tends to get wound around every spinning part. The brush, the beater, the third wheel, and the side brush all build fuzzy donuts of finely spun dog hair. The side brush only made it two days before it jammed. It was easy to fix, but it happened fast. After four days the brush needed serious hair removal.PERSONAL NOTESFirst night it ran sixty minutes and called for help. Turns out a wheel was jammed with lots of ribbon it found somewhere. It hasn't had a problem since.I wish it didn't require as much maintenance, but that is really because of the dog.This device would have been absolutely ideal for all of my apartments; have it run while you are at work, and you just don't need to vacuum -- that would have been incredible when I was single."
12/20/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great investment,Product works better then expected it runs around the whole house for around an hour. I was amazed at how much dirt and pet hair it picks up every time is cleans the bin is full. so far so good if it lasts at least 2 years I'll buy another one for sure.
8/23/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Five Stars,Product arrived in a timely manner and works fantastic! I love it!
8/17/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Not Perfect but Practical,"Problem: 2500 sq. feet hardwood floor + some low rug. Add 2 shedding indoor/outdoor dogs, kids, tracked in dirt.Solution: 4 Roombas run every other day. Clean Roombas once a week - takes 15-20 minutes to clean all of them.  (Use a shop vac to clean them up and out + added picks and brushes that come with the Roomba).Bottom Line: Are their drawbacks and problems; yes. BUT, it's infinitely better than vacuuming the place every couple of days. If I knew of a better solution I'd take it, but short of having live in help it's the best solution we've yet found. Know of a better way? Please let us know.Some Details:  Oldest Roomba is more than 4 years old and still cleans well though it's lost the ability to charge from the docking port.  The newer units are improved in that it is easier to clean out the long dog hair that inevitably gets wound around the inside parts.Cleaning is the worst part of these things. My tolerance limit is cleaning them once a week which is why we have 4 of them.  Cleaning several at one time is pretty easy - the key is to use a shop vac.  If you don't like getting your hands dirty or have the patience for taking little parts out and scraping off the fused dog hair, then this is not the solution for you."

4/6/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great Vacuum!,"Positives: This thing is a great Vacuum! Equally awesome on carpet and wood floors. It is so easy to program cleaning times. The floors look great!Negatives: It is not maintenance free! Also, You also have to pick up cloth, string and wire up or they will get sucked up and the Roomba will stop.It is also a pesky and determined little guy...it will push doors open and get in rooms you don't want it to if the doors aren't firmly secure.We have rooms that are separated by a floor molding that the roomba can't get over....so I have to plan what area of the house I want it in that night. It has also fallen over the edge of our kitchen/family room once or twice. There is like an 8 inch level difference. We have found it turned upside down on the lower level.  That's annoying but our fault. If you use the virtual wall...it's not a problem. It normally works, well...normally.The last negative is that it sometimes has a hard time backing up into it's dock. The dock is really light and the roomba can push it around instead of docking. When you first get it, it seems like it is cleaning in the most random patterns and that the brush is just throwing cheerios around...but when it's done...the floors look great.Conclusion: I just get annoyed when I see people complain about the roomba being a lot of work...because it does such a thorough job and all you have to do is move a chair or pick up your socks. There is some prep work involved but it is worth it. It picks up loose change...but does have a hard time with like beads or things bigger objects. So you have to pick up obvious things. When it is done with a room it looks super clean...so much better than if you did it yourself with an oreck.We Love it so much we are going to try a scooba."

12/18/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Insane, Just INSANE!","Picked this up at Target, I went back & forth for a bit as I had to reconcile it was ok to be lazy enough to spend this much on a robot vacuum when I have a regular one and a broom! Well after a week, I gotta say I don't regret the buy. Not only does it do an awesome job but I find myself confused by how much it picks up every day.I have a dog (westie) and two cats (one with long hair) and you wouldn't know it by looking at my floors. The only ""negative"" I would offer is that it's kind of loud. so it's best to let it run while you're not home. Otherwise it's a 100% GO FOR IT1"
9/30/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I am Disabled ---And I No Longer Need To Hire Housecleaners....iRobot is Life Changing,"Physically Disabled And Cannot Use A Vacuum - This Product is cleaning heaven.  I have wood floors, wool area rugs and a large Golden Retriever Service Dog....nothing is harder to clean than dog hair on wool  and hair balls that accumulate along the sides and corners of wood floors.  Also his long hair is like velcro for dead leaves, sticks and other debris that gets tracked in and spread around daily.....my floors have never been so clean and I THAT IS A GOOD FEELING when you can't do much cleaning yourself.I was concerned about the dog hair.  The only vacuum that worked was a Very Expensive Miele that does a but have to have someone do it for me and that would only happen a few times/month.  Now I have clean floors EVERY DAY.  Someone still does the furniture and other hard to reach places but with so little dirt and dog hair on the floor, little finds it's way into other places.Definitely makes my life easier as I have always been a stickler for clean floors and this machine picks of pet hair and even the finest dirt and dust.  Emptying the collection container is a cinch and cleaning the brushes takes less than two minutes.My favorite household item and the one that has made the biggest difference ....it's almost as good as having hiring housecleaners."

I wasn't convinced that spending this much $$ for a vacuum was worth it until I watched my sisters Roomba knock out 4 rooms until they shined.  And she has a dog!  We do not, but I can no longer tote around a heavy vacuum cleaner.  This is a wonderful solution.  It traverses my hard wood floors, rugs with ease.  I ordered the maintenance kit upfront - I know this little baby will get lots of use.  I have scheduled it every other day as it cleans so well it doesn't need a daily run.

2/5/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,It does a good job but requires a lot of maintenance.,"Overall it's a vacuum, it doesn't what it's supposed to do. It fits under things our normal vacuum don't. This saves us the effort of moving heavy furniture to clean under it. We've been amazed at how much it does pick up. However, even with the pet model like this expect your pet hair to do a real number on the unit. This has been running for 3 months now, we set it up to clean one floor of our house almost every day, so I'd say it runs 5 days a week, on a house that's about 900 square feet per floor. We have a dog with long hair, so it gets wrapped around both brushes, and it does damage them. We clean the Roomba thoroughly every time it's run, which takes about 5-10 minutes or so each time, but even with constant attention the rubber brush needs to be replaced after three months and the other brush isn't looking that good.Pros:We spend less time cleaning, 5-10 minutes a day at the most.It does a better job and gets into the places we normally can't.Cons:It does still require you to clean the Roomba every time you use it.The parts wear out and will need to be replaced often."
8/28/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Saves time, increases productivity and reduces frustrations!","Over a year of research and price comparisons, doubt and hesitations. What a waste of time! Darn thing is fantastic. Not nearly as noisy as I expected and in fact quieter than a regular vacuum. Emptying the bin after every use is not a big deal. weekly cleaning of the rollers etc. is really a non issue too. Spare parts for the potential  wear items appear reasonable enough on line although we have not yet purchased spares. We will, just to have them handy so we do not ever have to wait to keep it going. Three very large dogs are in the house about 40 percent of the day. Every morning I push start and go to work. Every evening I come home to a clean floor. Rarely has ""Heidi"" got hung up and when it does happen it is no big deal at all. The time saved has been worth every penny and the novelty has been entertaining. Used primarily on  porcelain tile with a couple heavy throw rugs, 700sq foot room with stairs and a drop off, lots of turns and furniture in odd places. She gets the job done. I have placed her in other carpeted rooms and also been amazed at the great job, but she lives in the main room. Don't watch if you are a linear personality, as her random patterns will drive you nuts. Just go do something else and come back to a cleaner floor. I do not worry about a visitor right after work seeing a drifting hair pile, and a bit of sand or gravel on a guests shoes doesn't make me nearly as upset, LOL."

Every night I empty her bin and am surprised to see how much has been picked up. I still need a regular vacuum for the corners and hard to reach spots, but if you can accept that Roomba is just going to keep the house looking good between cleanings you will be happy. Great for families with pets, and active lives. I have two dogs and do not get to the vacuuming as often as I would like to, good to know that Hazel has got my back"
5/6/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Does the job,"Our roomba 650 has done a great job cleaning our ~500 square foot first floor that has a mix of hardwood and rug floors. It's only occasionally gotten stranded, usually because it drained its battery fighting a cord it picked up. It's extremely easy to maintain, and does a great job on routine ""maintenance"" cleaning. The way it bumps around is charming, and it's not very noisy, about a loud electric box fan at max. Probably too loud for a quiet, sleeping house, but easily ignorable if you're awake and busy.Pets have quickly learned to ignore it, even my chicken scaredy-cat dog that's afraid of everything."
1/3/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Far exceeded my expectations,"Our Rooma's name is Rosie, based on the robot maid from ""The Jetsons"". And while she isn't serving us drinks (yet), Rosie does an amazing job cleaning the floor.This roomba's vacuum is amazing. Easily the equal of any full size vacuum we've used. Rosie cleans carpet, tile, and rugs with ease. We've stopped finding random cat hair around the house, even though our older cat seems to be desperately pulling out entire tufts of fur in an effort to go bald.More importantly is how effortless the entire thing is. We set a schedule (every day at noon) and she starts cleaning, goes through the entire house and then returns to her docking station autonomously. There's no 'making sure the roomba is charged' or having to find it after it finishes cleaning.I was skeptical about roombas for years. I thought they were a cool gimmick, but not really worth the money. Now I wish I'd bought one sooner."
3/31/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Gerty is A Workhorse,"Our new Roomba 650 is awesome. Her name is Gerty (think the movie Moon), and she has already had two runs. The only issue we noticed is that she had a hard time docking the first time when we placed the dock under a piece of furniture. She ran twice the first day for about 2 hours before finding her dock. Covered a 1400 SF downstairs without a hitch. Had to clean the bin and the brushes each time, but that took a LOT less time than vacuuming the downstairs twice. Now if we could just teach her to climb the stairs or groom our clothes of cat hair (we have 4 cats indoors)!"
1/31/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Wish we had purchased one sooner.,"Our little dog sheds and everyday we run ""Ethel"" our Roomba and are surprised every time we find the tray full of dog hair and fine lint.  She glides across our tile floors and carpeted bedrooms with ease.  We absolutely love this little machine and we're glad our daughter recommended it to us.  We're senior citizens and it has made our lives so much easier and the floors look so much cleaner and free of pet hair and dust."
3/28/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,Did not perform as expected,"Our house is a small ranch, but the Roomba had many problems in it. It got stuck behind our toilet, trapped itself in our bedroom and thought the dark spots on our multicolored area rug were cliffs that it had to avoid. We were considering getting a new area rug if the Roomba had performed well enough otherwise. But it did not. It couldn't even find it's dock effectively if its battery was getting low. The problem with finding the dock is that it's on a light sensor. My husband said that if it were a radio frequency it could come back from anywhere. But the way it is means that it has to just keep sweeping until it happens to pass close enough to the dock to see it's light. Maybe some of these glitches are worked out in the more advanced models. And maybe for the price it's ok if you have a very open floor plan so it can't get stuck on things. But we were not satisfied. It was more work to worry about whether Roomba was going to do ok while we were gone than it would have been to just sweep the floor myself."

I was concerned that our dark blue carpet would cause problems, but to no avail! Rosie cleans her way through our house doing all the carpets, tile, and over the rugs, I like how she navigates under the furniture and beds. I use one virtual wall to keep her from trying to clean under a large bookcase where she got stuck the first day on the job, but have had no other problems. I did order 2 other virtual walls to use near our Christmas tree. We will go out shopping or to dinner and leave Rosie to clean while we're away, when we return, our house is vacuumed and Rosie is back at her docking station relaxing and getting all charged up for the next day, life is great"

11/13/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Optimize your house for Roomba and let the cleaning begin,"Once you have figured you have to ""optimize"" your home for Roomba it does its job very well.  This means no loose cords on the floor, move some things a bit so it has the space to travel where you want it to clean.  After that, program it for the weekdays and watch it clean the house.  You have to remember to clean the dust bucket every day at first but gradually the house will get cleaner and it won't matter so much. Also remove hairs from the brushes with the special tool the first few days of cleaning after that a weekly cleanup will be fine.  Consider also cleaning the dust filter with compressed air once a week (push the air from the ""clean"" side of the filter, do it outside the house as a lot of dust gets trapped there).Once you understand you have to take care of the Roomba a bit (mostly in the beginning) then you will enjoy it.I gave it four star because it seems on some surfaces it will have problems: mostly long hair rugs which it might ""avoid"", plus we get the ""error 6"" and it stops cleaning on a black carpet when there is too much dust on the infrared sensors, it thinks it's about to fall from the carpet, go figure.  It's a great robot vacuum, not perfect but it does a good job.One last thing to note, having the charging base station in a ""central"" location of the house will make it easier for it to return there once the cleaning is done."

I had to Roomba proof the house (cords up, pet bowls protected) and had a few accidents with plastic bags and such, but otherwise things are going well. The only thing I haven't figured out is how to keep it calm while I am tipping it upside down to clean out the brushes. It verbally spew error messages when I expose its belly. But so does the cat."

1/3/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,2,"Starts off well, but didn't last a week","Ok, so we have a lot of wood floors and a yellow lab. Plenty of hair to pick up. First couple of days it seemed to do well, but maybe that was because it removed a majority of the hair. But as we set it about the rooms, we noticed that it wasn't really picking up that final 15%. We cleaned the bin, the brushes, talked with customer support, etc. It passes right over the hair multiple times. ""Rosie"" says she is done, we go in, bin hardly any hair/dirt in it, but we can still see the blond hairs on the wood floors. Shouldn't be that way. Customer service offered no help other than to return it to where it was purchased."
1/4/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"Yay, it works !","Ok, so I'm a bit tentative because I'm purchasing this as a gift for someone who is a cleaning wiz and had my doubts as to how well this little guy would perform. However, once charged, the Roomba did an incredible job of getting up unseen dirt from the carpet and left the hardwood floors looking spotless.  As has been recommended, cleaning the little guy out after each use insures that it will operate at its best.  Good one Roomba !"
9/15/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It has changed my life,"Ok, so I have the 655 model from Costco. Not sure exactly what the big difference is but it has an extra 5- maybe just to make Costco members feel special? Who knows. I was a early adopter of the Roomba first series. I hated it, it was crap. It was loud and basically crappy. I stopped using it after a couple months and eventually we sold it.Fast forward to now. I saw this new model at Costco hopped on Amazon to price compare and read reviews. The reviews were surprisingly good. Costco had a rebate at the time so the price was better to buy there. I bought it for myself for my birthday. It's a gift. I have two active kids that drag dirt and leaves from the outdoors and two cats. This vacuum has changed my life. I want another one. I have a 3400 sqft house and while it doesn't cover it well it does a great job. My floors have never been so clean. I am no longer resentful that crap is being tracked all over the house by 3 other humans and two cats. I vacuumed almost everyday which took up a lot of time. Now I have time to do other things to maintain the house, like mop, clean the bathrooms, etc."
6/23/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Best purchase I have made in decades,"OK, I have pet parrots, and they make cat mess look like a picnic!  This baby cleans the floor so very well, I absolutely LOVE it!!!!  It is so darn  smart that it can go over power cords, and know to leave them alone, but it is not put off by them either....it goes over cords gently, and vacuums BENEATH THEM!!  I can't say enough good about this.  It is the single best thing I have bought in decades.  I think it is worth even more than I paid for it, as it has zero problems.  (I have replaced my regular vacuum 3 times in 2 years, including a Dyson).  WOW!"
3/15/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,wow !,"ok, i don't ever write reviews.  which is hypocritical since i rely on amazon reviews even when i'm shopping in stores !!but, this thing is awesome.  i also have a Dyson vacuum at the house.  i have all tile floors thru out the house now.  i have 2 shar pei's and a longish haired cat.  i bought this model over the 630 cause you can program this one to vacuum the house while you're at work.  with 3 pets the hair can get out of hand and needs to be swept/vacuumed up at least every 2 days or so....and let's be honest.  most people work jobs all day you don't want to come home and vacuum the whole house every other day !  i'm amazed at the amount of debris, dust, and hair this thing has in it's bin every night when i come home and empty out the compartment.  it's usually sitting on it's dock recharging when i come home.  there's been a couple of times it's gotten hung up on a rug or power cord.....but after you remove the items it gets caught up on....no issues what so ever.this is a must have for any pet owner !!  i have it programmed to ""work"" mon-fri at 3pm.  so i never have to hear it working....just come home to a spotless house !!!  awesome !!!"
10/17/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Cute Cute Cute!,"OK, I confess I choose this model simply because it is the cutest design among all the models. It works pretty well, but since that's the only vacumme cleaner I own so I don't really get the chance to compare it to others. Anyway, we could all use a little bit whim in our life-----i.e., buy a vacuum cleaner simply because it is cute(OK, I confess my dog does not agree with me on this point)."
11/19/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Really good...most of the time.,"Ok, I admit I was a skeptic but decided to give it a try as I simply dread pulling out the canister vac. Roomba really does a fantastic job of getting into places where no broom dares to go, and through multiple goings-over under my cabinets are as clean as the rest of my floor. There we a couple of snags though.  Often it will go right over a chunk of something and leave it behind, only sometimes getting it on the second go round. The sound doesn't seem to bother some folks but I found it can get noisy (perhaps louder because we have hardwood?). Sure, you can run it when you are out of the house, and it then becomes a daily game of find the roomba, as it is rarely docked and recharging when we get home. It has been stuck under two chairs, the dresser after eating an errant tissue and often pushes its own docking station into a position so it can't dock and charge. Lastly, this is not a fantastic item if you live in a cramped home as the roomba needs a docking space that is clear and unobstructed, both for the vacuum to receive the signal indicating where the docking station is and then to be able to get to it. Problems aside, seeing the amount of dust and dirt it collects on a daily basis, I know that my house is cleaner after it runs, and I am finally able to get my 4 year old to clean up his Legos with the promise that the Roomba will gobble up whatever is left on the floor. If on the fence as to whether to invest, ask yourself this: which do you like least - messing with the Roomba or vacuuming?"
7/18/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Impressed,"OK,  When the wife said she wanted this I thought she was crazy.  This cant work, like most other gadgets.  But it does.  I am always amazed when it goes out and vacuums and then finds its way back home!  It does a good job of keeping the pet hair under control between bigger cleanings.  You do have to empty the rather small bin but overall impressed."
11/1/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Robotic Fur Fighter,"Ok lets start out with this. I have had seven roombas over many years . Some have passed on, some were retired, some ran off (I think kids were involved).From the simple red ones to the more advanced 560, the scooba, and now the 650. One thing you can count on with irobot is the higher the model number the higher the price and yes features. I feel there comes a point when the features get in the way of the product and we may be approaching that timeline.The red simple models are great. Do they pickup everything, no. Are they pretty reliable, yes. I have one that is five or six years old and all I have done is replace the battery. One other red one just went insane and died after two years.The scooba... well that was just a mess. It tried hard but could tell even when new it was just waiting to freak out and break down. Gave it away couldnt face the future loss as you do tend to get attached to them slinking around the house.The 560 was a complete dog. It started having nervous issues after only two months then the battery went. Replaced battery then all the warning issues. This one talks to you so she was always telling me her problems and what she needed and what she cant do. Im guessing just like a real maid that is high strung and bad temperament. Dead with the fatal error code 3 AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! Well that was three hundred bucks I will never see again. (insert sound of toilet flush). This is where I will recommend the square trade extended warranty. I never got it but should have.So it looks like all the new models die just after the warranty is up by a few days. So now I have three dead ones the others were trashed. The quality does not seem to be improving as fast as the complications. The more advanced the higher the chance of failure.The 650 is a little heavier than the 560 that I have (may she rest in peace). Everything about it otherwise seems just the same. It has better hair pickup and a few more bells and whistles but it should for four hundred dollars. With the reliability track record I dont think i would spend he dinero on this one. Find it on sale if you must. Just not comfortable with the longevity any more and customer service at irobot while friendly is not much help. There are lots of forums that will help you trouble shoot your issues. Maybe too many.650 so far its working as intended. We shall see. Old red and 560 sitting in garage awaiting burial.In the end I think irobot should FOCUS on making them better vacuums and less on new features and gimmicks. They could do it if they want to, and make them less complicated so they will last longer. As always if you have any questions just ask me.Update April 2013: 650 and old red still going strong."
10/29/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,For sure better than my old 530!!,"Ok I have been using robotic vacuums for about 7 years now starting with the old Roomba 400 and moving up to a Roomba 510, then a 530, and a 560. I also currently own an Neato XV11. I was really excited to receive this new Roomba 650 pet series because I have had problem with dog and people hair getting wrapped around the roller brushes on all my Roomba's and even the Neato XV11 would get some on it from time to time. I have been very pleased that after a week and half of heavy use not one bit of hair on rollers! I also noticed that this one picks up a lot more that my current Roomba 530. My Neato always picks up a lot but does not do edges anywhere as good as the Roomba so thus I have both a Neato and a Roomba. I have noticed that the run time on this new Roomba 650 is over 2.5 hrs and cleans very well. The new Roomba is also faster than the 530 and Neato. As for noise it is about the same as my old 530 and is much quieter than the Neato. The scheduling feature is also nice and handy but I do not really use it because I work from home so don't have much need for it but I always say it is better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. A couple of things I have noticed that are upgrades is the brush head that the older ones had some problems with looks to be upgraded and also has the Areovac and that is a big improvement for suction. Overall I have been pretty impressed but still is not a smart vacuum cleaner like the Neato and that is why the 4 stars. Yes I would recommend this to purchase. Thanks"

8/2/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"It's pricy, but I promise you won't regret it.","Oh Roomba...  How I love you.  I don't know what we did before this!  (We had dirty floors, I suppose...)Roomba is great at picking up dog and cat fur.  Sometimes he misses some things, but if you throw him back in the room and ask him to go over it again, he always picks it up.  You do have to be diligent about emptying his tray and cleaning him out (which I'm not the best at), but it's really not much effort.  He's such a time-saver and I can spend the time that I used to spend vacuuming actually doing other things.Expensive, but worth it."
12/6/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,best investment ever - I love this thing,"oh my goodness, best investment ever - I love this thing!! and my dog is adjusting to it and my grandson thinks it is the best ever!!  too cute"
12/14/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,I hate having to clean the bin constantly and unravel hair ...,"Nothing's wrong with it. I guess I have buyer's remorse for spending so much on an item that has limited capabilities. It does not function on high-pile rug AT ALL! just gets stuck and goes in circles. That's a bummer. I find I have to continuously pick it up and move it to where I want it to go since it doesn't travel over my high-pile rugs. I could have bought 3 high functioning vacuums for the cost of this one Roomba, and instead I have one low-functioning robot-pet-vacuum. I hate having to clean the bin constantly and unravel hair caught in the brush. It's too high-maintenance for me. Prefer a big strong vacuum that does the job manually once a week with control and efficiency."
11/29/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,1,Not Worth the Trouble!,"Not worth the money.  I bought this for my daughter to help her with household cleaning, so she could clean floors as she slept. It worked for a few months ( not good on carperts only hardwood or tile).  Then I ordered a replacement upgraded cleaning compartment, which only worked for a couple of cleanings.  It continues to stop after a few minutes saying to clean roller compartment when I just did.It is great for pushing our things that are under the sofa or beds, but that is it.  Much easier to sweep the floors yourself!  Jo"
1/17/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,doesn't pick up cat hair,Not to happy with this as it doesn't pick up the cat hair which it told me it would.  It's okay
7/15/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,Not the best robot vacuum I've ever had,"Not the best robot vacuum I've ever had. It gets suck on things frequently, yet won't go over my rugs that are on my hardwood. I had a Neato before the Roomba and I think it did a better job, it was cheaper too!"
9/22/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,I would recommend a more advanced unit at this point,"Not sure it's worth the price, but it does what it's supposed to in an average fashion.  I would recommend a more advanced unit at this point."
9/12/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,"Not perfect, but definitely worth every penny.","Not perfect, but definitely worth every penny.  Our Roomba is scheduled to clean every day of the week.  We constrain it to one room at a time, letting it clean one area per day.  I would say its success rate at returning to the base charge station after a clean is about 60%.Our Roomba will get stuck on seemingly silly things.  For example our Roomba seems to think that the height difference between our high pile carpet and the floor vents qualifies as a high cliff that it must avoid at all costs.  This leads to our little friend often panicking when it hits a floor vent and then stopping with an error.Other things that often cause issues for our Roomba are wires (the advertised anti-tangle feature not so great in practice) and the rogue flip-flop or sandal.But these are all acceptable issues when contrasted against the fact that this little robot vacuums a room in our home daily.The bottom line is this Roomba is worth the money.  However, I am excited to see the product line continue to improve and evolve."
3/15/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,best purchase I have ever made,Not kidding.  I never realized how much dust accumulates until I gut this little guy.  I have a 700 sqft apartment and roomba cleans it one time a day for an hour every day.  Every day it fills up its dust tray (about the size of 2 fists).  EVERY DAY! thats a ton!This one picks up dog hair like a champ and handles carpet and hard wood well.  It never gets stuck unless it sucks of something I left on the floor.One must have for roomba is this little circular comb that pulls all the hair off the rollers which I do once or twice a month.  There is a link to it at the bottom.  And just wash the hepa filter.  There is no point to buying new ones all the time.  Have one extra so you can put it in while the other dryes.Its a great investment and they are so much better than the old ones
7/8/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,It works best if you manage the space that you want it ...,"Not having one of these robot vacuums before, it takes some getting used to.  It works best if you manage the space that you want it to vacuum.  That being to clear all items that will cause it to get hung-up on or around (chairs, tables, tight spots, day packs, dog toys, etc.).  By the time these items are cleared, I could have almost just vacuumed the area manually with an upright vacuum.The product itself works pretty well.  I would prefer if it had a structured pattern that it followed rather than randomly streaming through, around the room.  As it proceeds through it's process, if I watch it, I often wonder if it is really going to hit all locations.  Once I scheduled it to run daily, in the early morning (before we get up), I don't have to listen to it, and I don't have to wonder if it is going to do a complete job.  When I enter the living area, it seems to have done a decent job of vacuuming the area.  It needs help around the edges of the room."
5/6/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Really good,"No problems with it whatsoever, did a tonne of research so the only thing for it was post quality cheers!"
1/22/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Great for hard wood and cats!,No more sweeping litter everyday! And doesn't scare the felines!
11/14/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,our Roomba cleans up my dog's treat crumb messes and is great for maintaining floors free of pet hair,"Nicknamed Walle, our Roomba cleans up my dog's treat crumb messes and is great for maintaining floors free of pet hair. Unfortunately, Walle doesn't go easy on the furniture or walls. If you have white tables/chairs/bookends/baseboards, be prepared to watch the Roomba slam into them repeatedly during its work. Still a great purchase for maintaining ""clean"" floors, but may leave marks on your furniture."

10/31/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,"Some improvements, one 'pet' peeve","Nearly RIP: After using this Roomba several times a day almost every day, it has finally been sent to the children's room because it takes too frequent breaks.  (Charging issues.)  I hope it will continue to threaten children to pick up their stuff from the floor.I'm really impressed by the improvements in this Roomba.  Since I've put it into use in my household of pets - pets outnumber people 2:1 - the pet hair and dust have gone down considerably.  I have been using aNeato XV-11 All Floor Robotic Vacuum Systemand was about to order the animal and filter replacements but was sort of balking at the price.There are a few things that this machine does much better than the older Roombas and even some things that are better than the Neato.  The improvements are huge.Improvements:Directionality: This one has much better directionality than my older Roomba.  This one identifies a line, like the couch, and then a wall or coffee table, finds out its length and then comes back and does the area in a cross zigzag pattern.  My older one seemed to pretty much bounce off walls.Going around furniture.  This one goes around the furniture better than my past Roomba and better than my Neato.  I had sort of gotten into the habit of putting the chairs up on the table (difficult because they are antique wrought iron and heavy) because the Neato does not go close to the chair legs and seemed to go right through the middle - avoiding touching anything.  This Roomba is a great improvement though because when it touches something, like a chair leg, it clings to it while it goes around it, leaving no dust bunnies unmoved by the experience.The edges.  This one does better than my Neato.  It clings to rather than avoiding walls.  Neato would identify a wall line and then follow a path about one inch away from the wall.Cleaning. It is easier to clean these brushes than the old one was.  This one also has a better bin for emptying.This Roomba is like the energizer rabbit.  It just goes and goes and goes.  I charged it completely before I used it the first time.  About halfway through a 500 square foot room, it just turned around and didn't make it back to its base.  The next day, however, it did about 1000 square feet several times.  Maybe it was just trying to make up for the day before, but the animals didn't think it was funny, not at all.My `Pet' PeeveCleaning out the brushes is still a problem for me.  I just don't understand why it has to be done so often.  This needs to be cleaned at the end of every use.  This means I have to dig my fingers in and clean it.  This is precisely the one thing I never want to do.  I am allergic to pets AND their hair.My first Roomba was given away and now, my Neato has also gone to a new home.  This is definitely better than both of them."

9/1/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Four Stars,My wife likes that it will clean under the bed
11/13/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I couldn't love it more,"My wife kept coughing for some reasons.  Our doctor could not find any problem.  I was thinking it might be related to the carpet.  I hired the carpet cleaner to clean up the carpet once.  Then, I bought the iRobot to vacuum the bedroom every day, and vacuum other unused rooms every week.  My wife stops coughing now.  Every time, I clear the dust compartment of the iRobot.  I see the thick dirty dust.  It scares me that this is what I have been sleeping with.  The carpet just hides the dust so we could not notice how much it was in the bedroom.  There are many good things about the iRobot.  The best one is it reaches the area that is hard to reach, e.g. It vacuums the dust under the bed.  The other thing I like is it docks to recharge when the battery is low.  After talking the pros, I find 2 cons.  First, it does not work really well with the hard wood floor.  It just pushes the dust around.  Second, I have a black color rug with white color dots.  It confuses the iRobot that the dirt could not be cleaned so it will keep running in circle on the same spot.  In sum, it solves my problems, and I really really love it."
12/4/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Love our Roomba!,"My wife and I love this little robot. We run it every day and it just about does our entire downstairs (3200 square foot home, approx. 1500 sqft downstairs). Helps us keep up with the dog hair from our black lab. We still vacuum once a week, but it keeps us from doing it 3 or more times each week."
3/16/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,No more hauling the vacuum upstairs,"My wife and I love the Roomba. We've had it for a few months now and it fits our needs perfectly.  We wanted something that would just clean around 700sq ft of space upstairs without us ever having to haul around a vacuum.With 3 cats and a dog, our upstairs master bedroom and upstairs hallway are always coated in animal hair. Once a day the Roomba runs and takes care of everything. No need to haul the vacuum up and down stairs, the hallway and bedroom are always nicely vacuumed. It's a bit pricey for what it does, but it does it very well."
12/22/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Why did we wait???,"My wife and I had talked about getting one of these, but just didn't. Finally I read the Amazon reviews and decided what the heck. Now, after about a month, we ask ourselves ""why didn't we get this years ago?""This thing has made our chore of cleaning up dog hair a thing of the past. We have hardwood floors everywhere, with some throw rugs around, and a beagle mix house dog. This dog just blinks and drops about 500 hairs each time. We could never really stay ahead it.But now, with this Roomba, we come home to clean floors daily. Programming is simple, maintenance is easy, and we couldn't be happier. It does a fantastic job. It's specialty is cleaning along walls and edges, but will eventually cover the entire living area. The virtual wall device has kept it away from our Christmas tree skirt nicely. It goes onto any and all of our various rugs without hesitation. It only once had a problem while turning on the edge of a thin bathroom throw rug, and it signaled it was stuck. No biggie, I smoothed out the wrinkle and pressed the clean button, and away it went again.Truly, we are elated with this thing. No more do we have to see the dog hair mess. It's always in check now. And I am amazed at the apparent durability of this Roomba. They have certainly done their homework on this thing. We couldn't ask for anything more (well, maybe if it could dump its own dirt bin). Ha!"
8/25/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Good for square rooms,"My second one of these.  It works well.  Best for rectangular shaped rooms without too many objects in the room.  For me, the room to be cleaned needs to be prepped so the device doesn't get trapped under something.  This version has an rollers that don't need to be cleaned of carpet strands like the previous version."

2/5/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Quite the Helper!,"My parents loved their Roomba, so I decided to go ahead and get one this past December.  I have 2 dogs and was having to vacuum every day to keep dog hair under control.  This Roomba works as advertised and has made keeping my floors clean soooo much easier.I auto set the Roomba to run our entire downstairs every morning before I wake up (tile floors).  It probably runs for a good hour and a half to two hours, then takes itself home to charge.  I empty the bin every morning, and once a week or so I flip it over and clean the removable parts.  This is very simple, and I had to do this with my regular vacuum anyways, so no biggie.  At lunch time, I take it upstairs (hard wood with area rugs) and let it run the rest of the house. It's just that easy.Overall, my house stays cleaner and I am much happier for it. I've also noticed a considerable reduction of dust in the air filter which is a big plus.  At the end of the day, this is totally worth it for all the time it has saved.  Thank you Roomba!"

HATE HATE HATE. its annoying, it gets me tired and sweaty. its hard to get under the bed. but now, i can just sit and watch tv as i vacuum. does a great great job overall.PROS:- vacuums while you relax or at work- cleans super wellCONS:- nickel battery, so you have to be careful how you use it. you have to drain it completely before you charge it. and when you charge it, you have to charge all the way.- does fall down the stairs on carpet b/c it can't read the soft ledge as well. i recommend putting the portable lighthouse there- cant get into corners that are too small for it to fit. sooo, inevitably, you have to vacuum yourself sometimes in the little nooks- louder than i thought, but not awfuloverall, i still LOVE it. saves me a lot of time. and i can get the dust out of my apartment so much easier now."

4/6/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,A godsend for pet owners,"My new apartment has wood floors and the fur bunnies from my golden retriever became more apparent than ever. It made me insane. I was obsessed with sweeping and found that I had to do so daily which I don't have time for. Roomba picked up these dust bunnies in the interim until my housecleaning day (saturday). If you think this will replace your vacuum, it won't. It will help with those fur bunnies in the meantime. Saves me so much time. I love it."

7/2/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Otto is da bomb!,"My husband named him Otto, our ""auto"" matic robot vacuum. I bought Otto with points on a credit card, hoping it would handle the daily tumbleweeds of cat hair from five cats and one dog (he doesn't shed). Other folks' reviews said it was good for pet hair, so I thought I'd try it since it's sort of free, as I could buy it with my points. And this is where I say...OTTO IS DA BOMB!This guy runs a room flawlessly. I'm watching him again tonight, navigating every spec of the floor, carefully pushing the small pile of dog toys out of the way, slowly rolling over the flippy flyer dog frisbee, working meticulously around chair and table legs. We've both noticed that sometimes Otto will miss a tuft of cat hair, and we make a mental note to check on it later to see if Otto came back for it and yes, he hasn't missed a thing! He transitions remarkably well from fwood (faux wood) floors onto area rugs, onto porcelain tile, to throw rugs, to plush carpet, no problem on anything. He has remarkable agility in managing varying heights. He can even roll up on to the base of a carpeted cat house, which has a good 1 1/4"" elevation from the floor.I'm shocked at just how much he collects on every single trip. Kinda scary, really. Running him in the bedroom was terrific because he cleaned under the bed very thoroughly, which is difficult with many vacuums. He can pick up a LOT of stuff as he cleans, including two catnip mice. It would appear that Otto has great sweeping abilities with his brush and rubber blade rollers, as well as good vacuum power.It sounds like we've given Otto a full identity. We have. And once you get yourself one of these remarkable machines, you'll think he's just as cool as we do! He does a heck of a great job cleaning the floors and carpets - better than most humans - and he's fun to watch! I still crack up when he stops, spins, and jukes back and forth real quick working a dirty spot. He reminds me of ""Wall-E"" and maybe that's why he's extra cool.Treat yourself to this magnificent invention! This is the gadget you thought was so cool when we watched The Jetsons!Well it's now the real deal and it's GOOOOOD!"
2/25/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,and it's like maids have been there,"My husband jokes that this Roomba (named Jeeves in our household) is my most beloved...well, yeah!  We have a 90 lb Akita, so trying to stay on top of sweeping and vacuuming is a nightmare with her.  Not now that we have Jeeves!  We get home from work, and it's like maids have been there....the floors are swept and my carpet is clean - it even has those lovely vacuum tracks to show it was freshly vacuumed!Jeeves navigates between rooms fairly well.  There is a bump between our kitchen and the living room, and I'd say he gets stuck there ~30% of the time.  Not a big deal to me.Also....poop.  Once, our beloved dog decided to dump a load in the kitchen while we were gone, while Jeeves was running.  Jeeves, plucky little guy that he is, went right in there and tried to clean it up.  Before he stalled out, he managed to fling poop all over the kitchen and wipe it on th baseboards.  0_0  It took us HOURS to get all that poop out of him and to sanitize the house.  It may have been the grossest thing either of us have ever had to work with.  Soooo, just be fore-warned, dog owners!!"
12/22/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Our New Best Friend,"My husband gifted me a Roomba six years ago. We returned it, because it wasn't performing up to par. We were sad to see it go, but it wasn't cleaning as well as we would have liked. Sooo, after many years, we decided to give it a other try. After all, the concept was ingenious.Relatively, we aren't big spenders. The kids hate to vacuum our main areas every other day (comprised of tile and wood). Yes, if I was a better mother, our floors should be vacuumed after every meal... Anyhow, my children miraculously agreed to put all of our money together and get one big family gift (ergo the Roomba 650) instead of individual presents.Oh my! Technology has changed the last six years. Our Roomba 650 (affectionately known as Estella) has added another notch to my happiness scale. My husband, the skeptic, was even amazed. He actually noticed and said things like ""Wow, the floor has never been this clean!"" The kids also observed how clean the floor was.I did a lot of research before purchasing. Here are some highlights:--- Some reviews recommended this model rather than the more expensive models. I agree. I don't have pets but there are three kids and seasonal allergies. I would end up losing the remote that comes with more expensive models, anyway. This model already allows scheduling.--- Our Roomba 650 has NOT gotten lost yet even though it goes into several rooms.--- As others have stated, it does get stuck among kitchen tables and chairs. My solution is to flip chairs onto the table/counter like they do at restaurants during closing time. My daughter likes to align the chairs in a line w/ a tunnel.--- The noise level is debatable because ""noisy"" is subjective. It is quieter than our three Dysons. I could hold a personal phone conversation but NOT a business phone conversation. It probably would NOT wake most sleeping babies. Possibly on the level of a cooking vent on low.--- It doesn't bother me to clean the dirt tray every time or every other time. For my house, I think we could even go four times before cleaning the tray. It was easy to pull out the tray, dump out contents, then rinse it."
1/5/16,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,A Pet Owners Dream Machine,"My husband and I received a Roomba for Christmas from my mom who visits regularly and likes to keep things tidy.  Although we vacuum 2x week with our Hoover, we still struggle to stay on top of the heavy amounts of fur that shed from our dog and two cats (all long haired).  We have been running the Roomba in the mornings and evenings when we are home to keep an eye on it - it is on its second run of each room and still picking up hair and dust that our vacuum left behind.  The thing is a powerhouse and so thorough.  It is loud and the cats are definitely alarmed and curious about it but it is nowhere near as loud as the vacuum that sends all critters running into another room.  Looking forward to clean floors and less dust in our future!"
4/5/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,amazing,My floors havre never been cleaner. I set it up each day to vaccuum while I am at work. love this
4/4/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I really just wanted a cleaning robot!,"My fiance got this for me for my birthday after two years of joking that we should just get a roomba instead of cats. Two cats later I clearly lost that argument but I do finally have a roomba.The bullet points:- it's about 1/3 the volume of our standard $80 hoover upright vacuum. If I run it while I'm watching tv, I might have to turn the tv up to 25 instead of 21. I feel like I could probably sleep with it running around our bedroom but my fiance says he absolutely could not.- we have a 700 square foot apartment, mostly carpeted, with a galley kitchen. I have never had it not be able to find its way back to base. Unfortunately sometimes it doesn't get into the galley kitchen that well because of the layout.- if I want it to really thoroughly get under the table I just flip one of the chairs up before I run it. I've never had it get stuck in chair legs!- I have spent probably as much time maintaining it in a month as I would have running the full size vacuum once through all the rooms. To be fair I'm probably babying it a little as it's a $400 cleaning robot and I want to make sure it keeps ticking.- it IS strong enough to push your pet food bowls around the floor. You can get a halo sleeve for the virtual wall and keep it between the bowls, or just pick them up before you run it; we're thinking about getting a cast iron base both to protect them from the roomba and to keep our cats from dragging them across the floor. It's a pretty smooth ride though - the one time I forgot to pick them up it pushed the water bowl all through the kitchen without spilling any waterToday I did a science experiment. I ran the roomba yesterday, then today I tore apart both my vacuums, cleaned them thoroughly,  ran the full size upright to see how much I got out of the carpet, and then ran the roomba again. The upright got probably two cups of fur and dust and etc out of the carpets (pre-roomba I'd get easily 4-6) and then the roomba got a large handful of fur and dust up after that. I definitely find it a worthwhile purchase even if it isn't going to completely replace my upright. The main difference is that before I would run the full size upright maybe every two weeks or so; now I can run the roomba every day or every other day. It's cut down a lot on the cat hair just sort of hanging around in the carpet, which is great since I'm mildly allergic. I also have psoriasis which means I shed skin flakes myself - yuck - and this keeps our floors quite clean.Unintended side effect is that I actually probably clean MORE OFTEN than I did before I had a roomba, but mostly because I start the roomba and then I think ""well, I might as well wipe down the counters while that's running""... ""I might as well dust out the PC since the roomba will clean up all the hair and dust I get out of it""... and so on and so forth. Also since roomba does tile/lino and not just carpet, I no longer have to sweep which was my least favorite chore ever and so I mop more often since the roomba cleans the lino well enough that I can just mop it without doing any prep work.Also prepared to be grossed out at what the roomba will dig up from under your furniture or in the depths of your closet - I've found hair in the rollers from easily a year ago. My cats are at the cautious acceptance stage - one of them ignores it, while the other stalks it around the house and tries to scare it by jumping out at it. In contrast they are both still 100% terrified of the full size upright."
12/31/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,3,Three Stars,My daughter and son-in -law love the IRobot Roomba 650. Great job cleaning hardwood floors and thick rugs
1/6/16,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Cool product but not a vacuum replacement by any stretch,"My bride has been in my grill for a year, maybe longer, to get a Roomba vacuum so, I got her this 650 model for Christmas.That went over poorly but ..... it is here and it is running around the downstairs like a little puppy and the bride uses the thing regularly so I am calling it good.Does it work good?  I am stating yes and no.  The little pan that catches dust etc fills up and has to be dumped so that means it is working.Personally, I think this thing may be best for getting under beds and chairs for dust.  I watched it in the kitchen on a tile floor for several minutes and it just ran over and past a few noticeable crumbs without ever picking them up."
12/2/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,An affordable housekeeper.,"My boyfriend has two large dogs and a cat.  I talked him into buying the Roomba.  It has been absolutely wonderful!  The Roomba cleans around all the edges, in the corners, under the bed and ottoman.  His house looks amazing!  We run it every day.  We named it Alice after the housekeeper in the Brady Bunch.  It really is like having a housekeeper."
5/24/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Fabulous For Pet Hair!,"My boyfriend brought over his Roomba 650 for me to try on my hardwood and Pergo floors. Though I'd Swiffered earlier in the day, I was blown away by how much cat hair, dust and assorted particulate it picked up! That sold me. I went to BB&B, got my own. Have used it three times in four days, and I'm still amazed by how much stuff it picks up. I have two cats that are prolific shedders. Roomba gets it all!!  Cleaning the brushes and bearings incredibly easy. People have complained about the difficulty cleaning these on older models. No problem with Roomba 650. If you have pets, or hate to vacuum, get a Roomba.  I'm thrilled with the purchase, pleased that it's an enormous time-saver."
3/9/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I'm so glad we did because it has been so easy cleaning ...,My boyfriend and I kept going back and forth on whether or not to buy one. I'm so glad we did because it has been so easy cleaning now. We have a dachshund who is quite the shedder. Our floors feel awesome after each cleaning. I wish it was easier to empty out the container but definitely a small con.
1/6/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Roomba Is Perfect For The Busy Bees,"My background:Let me start out by saying that I am very picky and skeptical.  I read a million reviews before I buy product and base my purchases off of it.  I've always been intrigued with robots ever since I was a kid and couldn't wait for the day that robots started working for us around the house.  I've been following the progress of iRobot's Roomba series for several years now.  My aunt is a dentist and not only did she buy a Roomba for every level of her house, but she also gave away Roombas to her employees.  They all loved it, but experienced some issues.  I didn't go off of their feedback so much, but more off of my dad's because he's a quality inspector to those robot arms that build our cars and other things.  He's just as picky as I am, except he gets paid for it, ha!  I was excited, but very patient in waiting for iRobot to update their designs.  They continue updating their design, but I think they nailed it on this design.Here's what I've experienced:My wife was skeptical of the entire concept and obviously not as excited about the Roomba as I was, so I ended up paying out of my pocket and bought it for us as a ""Christmas present.""  I bought it, because we have a cat that likes to track kitty litter all over the floor and everybody who has ever owned a pet already knows about the pet hair issues.  Pet or human hair is not limited to specific rooms.  It floats around all over the place.  These are the things that drive me nuts.  My first run in with Roomba was when I borrowed it from my dad a few years ago.  I had a two story apartment that I was moving out of.  I just wanted to make sure that the apartment was decent for the inspection so I let the Roomba go around and do it's thing while I finished loading up the vehicle.  By the time I was done, it was done and charging itself on it's charging station.  Granted, it doesn't climb stairs so I had to physically move it, but it seemed to have done a decent job and I passed my exit inspection.  I didn't pay much attention to the Roomba during my moving process.Now that I own my own Roomba and it's the updated design, I pay very close attention to everything now.  People say that Roomba has a life expectancy of a couple of years, but my dad and aunt have only replaced their Roomba once within a 12 year span and their second Roombas are still going strong.  So anybody who has done their homework, might have read some old reviews claiming that cords get tangled in the Roomba, the brushes break easy, the front caster wheel gets jammed and scratches the hardwood floor, and the bin fills up too fast and you have to change it out halfway through.  Not on this model: ALL FIXED!PROS:* It charges fast* It memorizes your houses map* Parts can easily be removed for cleaning* The cleaning accessories work very fast* It's not as loud as a standard vacuum cleaner* You can schedule it to clean (without paying for extra addons now)CONS:* It only gets 97% of the dirt* It can run into table legs at full speed before it adds it to it's mapping* You're supposed to dump the bin out after every vacuum cycleCONCLUSION:If you have a scaredy cat like us, it helps if you run the Roomba while you give your pet attention so they know that Roomba isn't a threat.  After the second run, our cat began following the Roomba around because of curiosity. Roomba changed direction and came directly at our cat, but one swing at it's front bumper told Roomba to changed direction.  Now our cat sleeps through it's cleanings.  I'm leaving out information that you may have read in the description already, but I will say that I pet series is the way to go.  Tests have shown that it will vacuum up 97% of the stuff on the floor and it does do a great job at getting stuff out of the corners, but you will still need to vacuum once a month to get that 3% that it might miss.  I trimmed my hair and left clipping on the floor.  Roomba doesn't vacuum in the same pattern as humans so it was interesting to watch it map out the room in it's own special way, but the end result was that all of the hair got sucked up with the exception of where the floor meets the carpet.  That's where that 3% likes to hide.  My wife and I stay busy.  If we're not at work, we're spending time with each other.  The last thing that we want to do is drag the vacuum out of the closet.  My wife now loves the fact that the kitty litter trails and random dirt on the floor will get picked up while we're at work.  It gives us more time to spend with each other and our cat at the end of the day and that's what I appreciate about having Roomba around."
7/15/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Happy in Raleigh,Much more than I expected. Does a great job cleaning the hardwoods and carpet! Very satisfied!!!
9/30/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,"I may not use this like others, but then again, maybe everyone does it this way...","Most people probably use this differently than I do.  I don't like to let it have free reign in the house when I am not about or someone is at least there to watch it.  My negative list below defines why.  It is similar to the old Ronco set it and forget it, then warning people about fire if they don't watch the appliance.Still, this is so way cool and does such a great job, I love it.  Today, I tried a test I never thought this could pass.  I put down carpet cleaner/deodorizer on a rug and blocked it in the room.  And it took it an hour of running about, but it picked it all up.  Oh, and it filled twice, which is a good thing, but it does shut off when it fills, so if you aren't there to empty it, that extra battery life won't do you much good.The battery is powerful and lasts a very long time.  I haven't had an issue with it yet, but as I mentioned, I don't let it have full run of the house. But it merrily executes is algorithm, which is kind of clever as you start to identify it.  It can identify an edge by hitting it at a certain angle, and then it walks the edge.  I was impressed enough it did this with furniture, but when it also vacuumed the trip on the rug, I was kind of flabbergasted.The unit also has this find the dirt feature, in which it spirals for a bit looking for dirt before it heads towards the problem area.  Usually only when it first starts up, but it is also kind of a smart approach.They have come up with square units, and I do not think the algorithm could work as well.  Squares have corners, and they tend to hit things.  The round design bounces off.  Does seem to leave some traces here and there at times, but it will get them the next time it runs.As I mentioned, I do not use this in the way most people probably do, but then again, maybe it is what most of us do.  I let it go wherever it want at first, but it would snag something, get stuck, fill up or whatever, and it would stop, or worse, keep circling forever in a small area.One day, I couldn't find the silly thing.  I had left it to clean two rooms and it wasn't there.  I am beginning to think aliens.  But it had actually pushed away a smaller piece of furniture and broken into an adjacent room, snagged up on my cell phone charger and tried to digest my phone.  Fortunately, the system doesn't keep trying.  If the brushes and such lock up, it stops.  But not until it had dragged my cell phone by the cord across the room.So, my pluses and minuses, in which the pluses far outweigh the negatives....Positives:1. Way cool.2. Fun to watch, at least at first.3. If you hate vacuuming, it is also a great feeling to sit and use your computer while you let this thing run about and do it for you.  Would only take you five minutes, and this will take an hour, but you feel like you have help.4. The unit gets up so much it scares me.  I didn't think there was much of a visible difference one time, and I checked the bin and it was loaded with stuff.  Hairy, dusty, dirty stuff.  Hey, how did that get there? I vac at least twice a year.5. Brushes are effective.6. Climbs rugs and such effectively.  Small rugs may get snagged up though.  Thresholds which are common in older homes are no problem.7. Makes you feel smart for buying it.Negatives:1. When it gets to an overhang, like a flight of stairs going down, it just stops. I was hoping the sensor would pick it up and back up.  But it doesn't catch it.  You can use those invisible wall things, but I just move a couple of pieces of furniture to get the floor underneath them clean and use them to block the stairs.  Not a biggie, but I was kind of disappointed when it didn't manage it.2. I would not give it any demerits for this, because it has to be limited based its size, but it still is worth a mention.  The back has a tray into which the filth is thrown.  It isn't that large.  So, even a small room will fill it up, and it stops.  So, if you think you are going to go to work, come home, and find the entire apartment vacuumed, it isn't likely.3. It has a slight incline towards the center.  And I believe if I measure it, it would amount only to a centimeter or two.  But there is still furniture that is perfectly the exact height such that the front goes under, but it wedges before it passes under and jams up.  it gets scratches as a result just outside the white line you see in the picture.  And it will work like the dickens to get out, but eventually it surrenders.  So, I have to know these pieces of furniture and block them off.How do I use it?  I just take it to the area I want to vac and create a fence of obstacles. I don't care about the parking intelligence that takes it back to its home base.  I have not yet seen the battery get to the point where it would do that before it fills up or gets snagged up in some way.  I have done like three rooms and it is still charged enough to keep going once the dirt is removed and obstacles or snagged items have been effectively addressed.Right now, it is upstairs cleaning our bathroom.  To monitor it, all I have to do is hear it.  Some people think it is a bit loud, but that makes it better for me.  Silence indicates it has shut off.I would never go back on this purchase.  I would buy it again in an instant.  Would I buy all the gimmicks?  Maybe one or two for stairways, but most of the time, knowing its limitations allows you to easily determine an effective obstacle.I am not sure if you remember the robot toys and such that would move about the room, hit a piece of furniture or some obstacle, turn around and keep on going.  They were fun, but they didn't work everywhere in the house.  This does, and attacks hard wood floors as well as carpet, climbs the edges of rugs, gets under many pieces of furniture, and makes you often wonder how it did what it just did.That is cool, that is fun, and while the cool and fun are going on, there is actually work getting done too!!"
10/16/14,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,Better at chores than my kids!,Money well spent.  I come home and my Roomba has already swept my house.  I could never get my kids scheduled like that...
10/25/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Four Stars,Mom loves it. Period.
1/16/15,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,4,Gets under the beds and furniture and that's great. We have all wood floors,May take a little micro managing at first. Runs every day and keeps the dog's hair under control. Took a few weeks to iron out our stuff on the floor. It gets snagged under a few spots in the kitchen once and a while. Gets under the beds and furniture and that's great. We have all wood floors. 1 story house. 1800 square feet. We like the noo-noo.
12/20/12,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,I love my roomba!,"many have mentioned that they name their roomba's and we are no exception.  Ours is named ""ham"" my son thought that would make the most sense.  We have 3 floors (finished basement with 2 large rooms, main floor with 5 rooms, and upstairs with 5 rooms.  However, we only have one area rug and the rest of the house is tile, wood, or painted concrete. The roomba can do 2 floors on a single charge.  The scheduler is overrated since you have to empty the bin and clean the brushes.  Long hair can get pretty tangled up but if you keep vigil it won't be a problem.  I'd much rather spend 5 minutes cleaning it thoroughly every 2-3 days and have a clean house than vacuuming as much as the robot does."
8/19/13,iRobot Roomba 650 for Pets,5,It's like you're living in the future!,"Man, buying a Roomba changed my life! It is so thorough and the fact that you can schedule it saves so much time and hassle. I had to disable the cliff sensors with strips of white paper and painters tape (google it for exact technique), because Roomba refused to go over my black carpet thinking it was a cliff. The operation was easy and because I don't have any stairs, I don't need the cliff sensors anyway. Besides that little mod, it runs like a dream. I have several thick cables running across some parts of my floor and Roomba just goes right over them without so much as a second thought. There is one section of my apt that it always gets jammed up in, so I set up the included invisible wall to keep it out of that small corner. Roomba won't even go near the actual invisible wall unit which is pretty cool. You can keep Roomba away from more than just rooms with it. Roomba cleans my hard wood floors and my low pile carpet equally well and moves from one to the other perfectly. I live in a one bedroom apt and a full cleaning cycle takes about 1 hour and 15 minutes. That's a lot longer than I would take to vacuum manually, but I wouldn't be vacuuming under the bed and a bunch of other various corners that Roomba happily takes care of. It feels great to always have clean floors. It is also very cool having a robot regularly clean for you. It's like being in the Jetsons. Roomba even makes fun sounds when it starts and finishes. I love this thing. It has dramatically improved my quality of life."
