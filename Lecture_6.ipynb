        "#Language Modeling\n",
        "Language modeling in natural language processing (NLP) plays a pivotal role in the development of intelligent systems that can understand and generate human language. Essentially, a language model aims to predict the likelihood of a sequence of words or the probability of the next word given a specific context. By capturing the underlying structure and patterns in textual data, language models facilitate various NLP tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, and conversational AI.\n"

        "#Probabilistic Language Modeling with n-grams\n",
        "Probabilistic language modeling using n-grams is a fundamental approach in NLP that leverages the statistical properties of text to predict word sequences. An n-gram model represents text as contiguous sequences of n words, where the context for predicting the next word is limited to the previous n-1 words. For instance, a bigram (n=2) model restricts the context to a single preceding word, while a trigram (n=3) model considers the two preceding words.\n",
        "N-gram models estimate the probabilities of word sequences by calculating their frequency in a given corpus. They utilize the Markov assumption, which states that the probability of the next word depends only on the preceding n-1 words, thus simplifying computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite their simplicity, n-gram models have been widely used in various NLP tasks, such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text generation. However, they have limitations, including data sparsity and the inability to capture long-range dependencies in text. The emergence of more sophisticated techniques like deep learning-based language models has shifted the focus, but n-gram models still hold relevance as a foundation for understanding language modeling and its development.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this session, we will explore n-grams-based language modeling. We will also explore language modeling using word embeddings.\n"
